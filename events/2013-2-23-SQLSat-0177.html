<h3>So Many BI Tools, So Little Time</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft has a broad range of tools that can be used to create a BI application:  Power View, Reporting Services, and Excel (Pivot Tables  Power View) on the presentation side and SQL, Analysis Services (MOLAP  Tabular), PowerPivot, and Excel models on the data side.  Which ones should you use when?  Should an application mix and match or should an application focus on a limited set of tools?  While the technologies in each class have similarities (Power View, Reporting Services, and Pivot Tables all have bar charts), they are fundamentally different and should be used in different circumstances.  Compare the tools and learn nuances of each of them by seeing them in the context of real world examples.  See how choosing different tool str</p>

<h3>Big Data for the SQL Server DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you’re like most Database Administrators then you already work with data that is big, so what is this big data thing all about?  This session will cover the significance of big data by comparing and contrasting it to the SQL Server relational database environment.  It will also demonstrate the value a big data ecosystem can provide to your technology infrastructure organization by using it to complement your existing data architecture, and by having it co-exist in effective ways with your SQL Server databases. Live demonstrations will show how you to get maximum value out of big data with tools such as Sqoop, Hive and Pig so that you can perform bulk data transfers, queries, and ETL using SQL Server and HDFS, the Hadoop file system. </p>

<h3>What is the Best Disaster Recovery Solution?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It depends, every situation is different. The question is often asked of DBA's to provide a solution to very open ended requirements.  However, the best solution can only be provided if the database professional is getting all the answers.  This session is a case study into many of Disaster Recovery options that we as database professionals have.  Understand the answers to the important questions that  we should be asking to provide the best solution not only for the database but for the business as well.  As an attendee you will learn how to change an answer from it depends into a solid solution that can be built upon. We will take examples from experiences and as a group determine what the best solution is.</p>

<h3>Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.</p>

<h3>Stop Bad Data in its OLTP Tracks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Incorrect, inaccurate and misleading data can get into a database in a variety of ways. It causes bugs, impacts customers and hurts business. This session will explain how DBAs and developers can proactively ensure the data coming into a transactional system is clean and correct. The topics covered will include table design, the pitfalls of NULL, “garbage in”, transactions, change management, and coding standards. 

The presentation will draw on the speaker's years of personal experience managing busy e-commerce databases supporting multi-million dollar businesses. The speaker will use real-life examples and demos to illustrate the many ways that OLTP data quality can be compromised.</p>

<h3>Get TurnedOn with AlwaysOn</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there were 2 SQL Solutions named High Availability and Disaster Recovery. They had a love hate relationship and could never find a common ground. That is, until SQL Server 2012 brought them together in a love story built for the ages. When the dust settled, a beautiful new feature was born. It was called AlwaysON and brought with it new technologies like availability groups, read-only mirrors and listeners. It was a perfect blend of both HA and DR all wrapped up in one bundle of joy. 
SQL Server AlwaysOn provides a high-availability and Disaster-recovery solution for SQL Server 2012. Come see and learn some of the new features associated with it, how they work and why this new feature of SQL Server 2012 is so wonderfu</p>
