<h3>Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.</p>

<h3>New Frontiers: Platform Independent Full Stack Development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For years, those of us who wanted to use non-Windows-based machines to do .NET or SQL Server development have been caught in a "worst of both worlds"-type of situation. We have had to use some sort of Windows VM or have had to go without a local copy of SQL Server. The good news is that thanks to Microsoft's efforts, we can now do full stack .NET development without ever touching a Windows VM or work arounds! In this talk, I'll live code a simple service with database back-end while introducing platform independent tools such as Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio and SQL Server for Docker. Along the way, I'll discuss key differences and limitations between the Windows tools and their platform independent counterparts.</p>

<h3>SSDT, Docker, and (Azure) DevOps: How to Make Your Database Builds a First Class CI/CD Citizen</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Your application developers benefit from Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices to accelerate feature deployment and catch regression issues up front, but your database deployments are still stuck in the proverbial dark ages. The build scripts might be in source control or even an SSDT project already, but deploying is still an exercise in creating the perfect script, and don't even think about making a data (or data type) change!

SSDT and Azure DevOps can solve some of these problems, and even give us a window into the world of automated testing. In this talk, we will explore how to automate your database builds and deployments using SSDT and Azure DevOps, and we will explore automated testing using tSQLt and Docker. Lastly, we will check up on some tasks that you cannot (or should not) automate and talk about how to make sure your application developers are not left behind.</p>

<h3>Practical SQL Server Internals for T-SQL Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wonder how the SQL Server storage engine processes your T-SQL queries? Curious about what else you could be doing to improve query performance?

Having basic exposure to SQL Server Internals enables one to write more effective T-SQL. Join me as we peek into the black box of the storage engine. Topics will include an overview of the storage engine, indexing, and the query optimizer, accompanied by practical consequences and solutions.

When you leave, you will have a greater understanding of the storage engine and how to avoid T-SQL design patterns that negatively impact performance.</p>

<h3>Handling Role Playing Dimensions in Tabular Models</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most data models contain at least one situation requiring role playing dimensional behavior. For example,  Order Date, Ship Date, and Invoice Date all linked to the Date table. The tabular model, available in Power BI, Power Pivot, and SQL Server Analysis Services, provides multiple methods for handling role playing dimensions. In this session, we will implement examples of each of these alternatives, including the DAX expressions required to fully exploit each one. We will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each approach as well as best practices when implementing each of these alternatives. Special emphasis will be given to model maintainability as well as the experience created for users exploring and analyzing the model.</p>

<h3>Learn History from Temporal Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without needing any triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.</p>

<h3>JSON for the Data Mortals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you see curly brackets stored in your database and wonder what that is? Are you a DBA, with developers storing JSON in your database? As a database administrator or developer, it's important to understand JSON today.  This session will explain what JSON is, where it came from, and why it is showing up all over the place.  When you leave this session you will understand how to investigate, manipulate, and validate JSON in your database.  You will walk away with example code of how to use Microsoft’s additions to SQL Server to use this data.</p>

<h3>Principle of Least Privilege: The Key to Strong Security</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A truly strong security model starts with no permissions and adds what is necessary to allow the user or application to do their assigned task - no more, no less. This is called the Principle of Least Privilege. It's a simple concept, but it can be quite difficult to implement in practice, especially if the prevailing practice has been much more permissive.

In this session, we'll talk about the Principle of Least Privilege in more detail, and we'll discuss ways to implement it for the three primary classes of users - general users, applications, and administrators. Each has their own set of needs that requires a separate approach to allowing the security to meet those needs. You'll leave with actionable ideas on ways that you can improve your company's security while minimizing the impact of the changes.</p>

<h3>Relational Data Architecture 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.</p>

<h3>Always Encrypted - Now with Enclaves!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Always Encrypted was introduced in SQL Server 2016, and it was a big step forward for encryption - but it had a very long list of exclusions which prevented it from being adopted by many organizations. Now, with SQL Server 2019, Always Encrypted is getting some much-needed improvements to its functionality. By utilizing the secure enclave capabilities of Windows 2019, SQL Server adds some impressive new abilities to work with data while it is encrypted. In this session, we’ll explore the secure enclave, and we'll see how you can leverage the new capabilities of Always Encrypted in your environment.</p>

<h3>APPLY Yourself</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</p>

<h3>Tracking Data Transformations Using Temporal Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Along with change tracking and change data capture Microsoft has introduced a new method for tracking data changes within its databases called Temporal tables.  Microsoft introduced temporal, or system-versioned, tables in SQL Server 2016 as a new database feature. A temporal table truly introduces two tables into the mix: one for current data and another for historical data. This talk will show how the feature is implemented and used along with a discussion on the common usage for temporal tables. Comparison to change tracking and change data capture will also be discussed. Scripts will be explored for the automation of the creation of temporal tables along with its use in data warehousing.</p>
