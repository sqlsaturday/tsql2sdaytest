<h3>Biml for Beginners: Script and Automate SSIS Development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you tired of creating and updating the same SSIS packages again and again? Is your wrist hurting from all that clicking, dragging, dropping, connecting and aligning? Do you want to take the next step and really speed up your SSIS development?

Say goodbye to repetitive work and hello to Biml, the markup language for Business Intelligence projects.

In this session we will look at the basics of Biml. First learn how to use Biml to generate SSIS packages from database metadata. Then see how you can reuse code to implement changes in multiple SSIS packages and projects with just a few clicks. Finally, we will create an example project that you can download and start with to speed up your SSIS development from day one.

Stop wasting your valuable time on doing the same things over and over and over again, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!</p>

<h3>Responding to Extended Events in near real-time</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events provide deep insight into SQL Server's behavior and allow us to gather information not available by other means. However, compared to other technologies such as SQL Trace and Event Notifications, Extended Events don't seem to provide a way to react to the events as soon as they happen.

In this session we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time fashion. We will demonstrate how this technology enables new possibilities to solve real world problems, such as capturing and notifying deadlocks or blocking sessions. We will also offer a different approach to analyzing captured events, without shredding XML files.</p>

<h3>Implementing a hybrid data warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The last couple of years have seen the emergency of "Big Data", "Cloud" and "Internet of Things".  Subsequently, Gartner at the 2016 Gartner Summit in Barcelona declared the Enterprise data warehouse (EDW) as dead. 
Which of course is silly. Sensible companies don't just throw money out of the window.
But they need to adapt and change when new opportunities arrive.
Enter the hybrid data warehouse. Combining the power of big data and cloud with your trusty EDW.

This session will take a look at a few different approaches to a hybrid data warehouse, with components such as SQLServer 2016, Azure Data Lake, HDInsight, Azure Analysis Services, Azure SQL Data warehouse and Polybase, with some scenarios where the approaches might become
 relevant. And some pitfalls you need to know about along the way.</p>

<h3>Custom maps in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s go beyond the standard visuals available in Power BI for making maps. In this session we won’t talk about Bing or ArcGIS services. We want to explore all the available features for creating custom maps without having to rely on existing ones. 
Do you know what is a shapefile? Do you know how to create your own choropleth and import it into Power BI? 
What else? R support into Power BI opened the doors to the huge number of packages for spatial data analysis and statistical calculations included in the environment. 
Do you want to draw multi-layered interactive maps? Want to geocode your data with direct calls? With R in Power BI, now you can. 
Last but least, we will able to discover Synoptic Panel, an awesome component that connects areas in a custom image with attributes in the data model and draws the data on a map. There are endless possibilities; the only limit is your imagination!</p>

<h3>Python revolution in SQL Server world</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Python is one of the most popular languages this days and we are very excited to have an ability to use Python inside SQL Server stored procedures starting SQL Server 2017.

Machine learning is not the only usecase for this wonderful feature, it can solve many challenges when dealing with text files, bulk loads and even simplify ETL flows when you need to move data from databases other than SQL Server. Moreover, you can offload the big data querying to nosql database and use Python to get the results into SQL server.

Target Audience:
Application and Infrastructure DBAs that want to see various usages for Python language from inside SQL Server stored procedures.</p>

<h3>Chatbots for Dummies</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The software development landscape is changing. More and more, there is an increased demand for AI and cloud solutions.  As a user buying cinema tickets online, I would like to simply ask "I want to buy two cinema tickets for the movie Dunkirk, tomorrow's viewing at 1pm" instead of manually following a pre-defined process. 

In this session, we will learn how to build, debug and deploy a chatbot using the Azure Bot Service. We will enrich it using the Microsoft Cognitive suite to achieve human like interactions. 

Will it pass the Turing test, no, but we can extend the bot service using Machine Learning (LUIS), APIs (Web Apps) and Worflows (Logic Apps).</p>

<h3>Boring is stable, stable is good - best practices in practice</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Everybody is talking about best practices, and like standards, most everybody has them. But why do they look like they do, and why would you use a specific set of "best practices" that someone has put together? This session goes through my set of best practices that I've accumulated over 20 years of DBA work, disassembles each and every one of them to see how they came about and discusses why I still use them - or don't. There is no such thing as the ultimate best practices, but I aim to provide the attendee with as much food for thought as possible in order to let each and everyone decide on their own path forward for their own set of best practices.
The session covers primarily SQL Server 2012 to 2016, with SQL Server 2017 thrown in for good measure.</p>

<h3>I/O Tuning 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.</p>

<h3>What are Azure SQL Database Managed Instances?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The range of options for storing data in Microsoft Azure keeps growing, the most notable recent addition is the Managed Instance. But what is it, and why is it there? Join John as he walks through what they are and how you might start using them.

Managed Instances add a new option for running workloads in the cloud. Allowing near parity with a traditional on-premises SQL Server. Including SQL Agent, Cross Database Queries, Service Broker, CDC, and many more. Overcoming many of the challenges to using Azure SQL Databases.

But, what is the reality, how do we make use of it, and are there any gotcha’s that we need to be aware of? This is what we will cover, going beyond the hype and looking at how we can make use of this new technology.</p>

<h3>Enabling Citizen Data Science with Microsoft</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In times past, Data Science was only for those elite few with a rare combination of skills including advanced knowledge of statistics.
Microsoft has been making sure that everyone can participate in the data revolution by giving people access to predictive API’s, in-database advanced analytics and drag-and-drop predictive experiments. All thanks to SQL Server 2016 and the Cortana Intelligence Suite in Azure.
These advances have given people with less knowledge of statistics and programming the ability to become what Gartner calls citizen data scientists. Should we be worried about creating fools-with-tools or should we embrace the democratization of data science as the golden age of data?
In this demo heavy session we explore Microsoft’s solutions to ensure democratization of data science and the possible dangers that lurk below the surface.</p>

<h3>Experts should work with facts, not guesstimates</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Experts should work with facts, not guesstimates – how you learn to love large scale SQL Server consolidation projects

Have you ever been struggling with the consolidation or migration planning of a sizable SQL Server platform? Traditional data platform capacity planning contains a lot of time consuming manual work and is often based on rough estimates. It is seen more as a task for the data platform architect than a mathematical challenge. The truth is: It is both. Find out how to achieve highly automatized, perfectly optimized plan, based on facts rather than guesswork!
