<h3>Seeking the Perfect Hybrid:  On-Prem Data with Reports and Dashboards in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For many new Power BI implementations, initial self-service and team objectives are soon met, and the natural evolution of Power BI turns to an organizational focus.  In other scenarios, the enterprise seeks to preserve its investments in "classic BI" by integrating Power BI with Analysis Services and the underlying data warehouse.

In this session, Data Platform (SQL Server / BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson explores the construction of organizational BI solutions, wedding the "traditional" solutions with the reporting and analysis power of Power BI.  We'll focus upon the components of a "traditional" solution, up to the semantic model (with SQL Server Analysis Services as an example), and then explore paths to the implementation of an end-to-end enterprise solution that uses Power BI as the presentation layer.
This session applies, in most respects, to Analysis Services 2012 and above.</p>

<h3>Don't Let History Be a Mystery! Temporal Data in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It's been said that the only constant is change, and no truism better defines the average database workload. With data constantly shifting in form and focus, DBAs and developers find themselves fielding myriad questions about whens and whys: When did this fact get updated? Why is data quality lower than it was last week? And where did my sales figures go?!? Solutions such as Change Tracking, Change Data Capture, and hand-rolled triggers can each be leveraged to help in this scenario, but with various ugly tradeoffs. SQL Server 2016 introduces Temporal Tables, a new technology that finally gets us what we've needed all along. In this session you'll learn how to enable seamless and automatic history collection, take control of a great query experience, and build on a solid platform to help your users understand data history. By taking advantage of this fantastic feature, you'll approach your next project ready to answer all of the questions that constant change brings to the table.</p>

<h3>In-Memory OLTP for Developers: What You Need to Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the significant improvements made to in-memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016, it’s natural to expect significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  

In this session, we are going to take a look at in-memory tables, their best use cases as well as development best practices. We will also look at the changes to the indexing design for inMemory-based objects and how it differs from existing disk-based table indexing. Finally, we are going to cover how to build fast, scalable applications which utilize inMemory objects, as well as choosing the appropriate indexes for your inMemory objects to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.</p>

<h3>Demystifying Data Compression</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 SP1 makes data compression available in all editions. Data compression can reduce storage costs, and provide a performance boost—and now compression is available without the added cost of Enterprise Edition. Whether you are a developer or a DBA, it's important to know how to use compression to save money and improve speed.

Come learn about how data compression actually works, the differences between ROW and PAGE compression, and learn how to pick the best compression level for your data. This session will cover the details of the compression algorithms, and the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. 

By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.</p>

<h3>I/O Tuning 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.</p>

<h3>Got stress?  Sometimes the SQL Server needs some too</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We hear it in every session and every webinar “…test…” regardless of it being upgrades, new code, performance tuning or any of a thousand changes.  Once we confirm nothing breaks., we don’t need to check anything else, nothing could possibly change the results, right?  What about load on the database(s) in question or the server as a whole?  In this session four readily available tools, distributed replay, Hammer DB, SQL Query Stress and oStress will be introduced.  The session will cover how to use the tools as well as which situations they shine in.  Once introductions are made, we will spend a little time with two of my favorites, HammerDB and SQL Query Stress.  Join me as we apply a little heat to our SQL Servers.</p>

<h3>Why should I care about ... the plan cache?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</p>

<h3>Ensuring Plan Stability with Query Store</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 introduced Query Store, a new feature which tracks query metrics and can be used for troubleshooting, testing, and proactively monitoring a workload.  Query Store also provides the ability to force a plan for particular query, which means you may no longer need to use those tricky plan guides.

In this session, we'll start with a quick review of how Query Store works.  Then we'll examine plan forcing in depth, including why a forced plan will fail and how plan forcing compares to using plan guides.  Expect a lot of demos as we investigate how Query Store can help you do more than just troubleshoot issues, but also manage query performance.</p>

<h3>Anatomy of a Transaction</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In SQL Server, the transaction log is the most important file in any database.  All changes to the data and schema are tracked in the transaction log.  Join me to learn how to read the transaction log, how to follow a transaction as is processes, and how SQL Server handles a transaction rollback.  You will also learn how to identify the resources and objects SQL Server accesses during the course of the transaction.  Finally, you will see how SQL Server processes transactions for In-Memory tables.</p>

<h3>Wait Statistics - The Top 5 Waits You Should Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Wait statistics are a great tool for troubleshooting performance problems in SQL Server. However, there are so many different wait types in SQL Server, it can be challenging to determine what to focus on and what can be ignored. Even after discovering that SQL Server is waiting for something, most DBAs don't know where to look next. In this session, we'll examine 5 of the most frequently seen wait types in SQL Server and how to troubleshoot each of them. You'll learn how to determine the root cause of a particular wait type, and how to avoid common mistakes made when troubleshooting with wait statistics.</p>
