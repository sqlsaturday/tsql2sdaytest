<h3>Advanced BIML - for the advanced ETL developer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This is not your regular Agile yada yada BIML session. 
By now you already know that BIML is a great productivity enhancement to SSIS. You also know that you can build metadata driven solution and include C# code in your BIML scripts or snippets.  If you don't know what I'm talking about this session is not for you. If you - on the other hand - want to know how to build a modular BIML framework, do real C# development and include it in your BIML code so that you can pass custom objects around for optimized performance and code reuse then this session is for you. I promise you no more than 5 slides but a lot of demos and real life experience acquired from major BIML projects. We will also have a look at how to harness integration and unit tests in the setup with a twist of Continuous Integration.</p>

<h3>Revolutionary R integration in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The R integration brings a lot of benefits and new scenarios to on premises data platform systems:
•	R can greatly simplify collection of different data.
•	Data manipulation and preparation can also be way easier with R.
•	You can use R to quickly explore and visualize data. 
•	Last but not least, R brings the whole power of modern data mining techniques to SQL Server.   
As if this was not enough, you can use familiar user interface and SQL Server Enterprise R Services to work with large datasets and multi-threaded, multi-core, multi-process computations. So, even if you don’t know R at all, come and see how natural this language is for everybody who already think in rows and columns.

<h3>Mastering DML Operations like a master</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DML operations mean lots of work for the database engine of Microsoft SQL Server. Understanding the details of a transaction may give you great benefits when planning workloads for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations.
This session will demonstrate the huge difference of allocation data in a heap and in a clustered index. If you don't know the benefits of correct record size and / or you are wondering how you could release allocated data pages in a professional way this session may give you all the answers.

- data page allocation and its difference for heaps and clustered indexes
- what is the amount of translog when you update data in a heap and/or in a clustered index
- delete data from a heap and what is the huge difference to a clustered index?
- speed up ETL processes by usage of the right strategy for INSERTS and DELETES
- Page Splits vs. Forwarded Records
- do you really need a clustered index in a table? Pro's and Con's of clustered indexes for DML operations

<h3>DBA Vs. Hacker: Protecting SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This was never showed before, a Hacker and DBA fighting against the time! The brilliant hacker mind trying to intrude and gain access inside of SQL Server to steal the most valued data using the Kalil Linux distribution when in other side the DBA avoing such achievement by using the security best practice and features available on SQL Server.

A Hacker's goal is to find vulnerabilities in a system and a DBA's goal is to make the environment secure and reliable. In this session we will learn how to protect SQL Server from the various forms of attacks that a smart hacker can throw at you. Let's dig in the Hacker thought process to understand the inception of the attack and how to defeat the invasion. Join with me in this internal session using SQL Server and Kali Linux for the ultimate security showdown!

<h3>Introducing the SQL Server 2016 Query Store</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of the public preview versions of SQL Server 2016 we were finally able to play with, in my opinion, one of the most exciting new features in SQL Server 2016, the Query Store! The Query Store serves as a flight recorder for your query workload and provides valuable insights into the performance of your queries. It doesn’t stop there however, using the performance metrics the Query Store records, we can decide which Execution Plan SQL Server should use when executing a specific query. If those two features aren’t enough, the Query Store provides all this information inside easy-to-use reports and Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) removing a great deal of the complexity of query performance analysis.
During this session we will take a thorough look at the Query Store, it’s architecture, the build-in reporting, DMVs and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store. No matter if you are a DBA or developer, the Query Store has information that can help you!</p>

<h3>JSON    XML;  since SQL 2016 it is important to weigh respective advantage</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The session begins with „JSON“ and shows with a syntax-comparison the similarities to XML.
Both the different operational scenarios and the technical background
of JSON and XML, however, require a different range of functions and language.
Therefore, initially, as far as practicable the parallels will be demonstrated.
Especially the T-SQL  extensions  „FOR JSON“  and  „OpenJSON“  are very similarly implemented in comparison to „FOR XML“ and „OpenXML“.
Furthermore the new functions  „IsJSON“,  „JSON_VALUE“ and  „JSON_QUERY“  are now contained in T-SQL. Do they also have these as T-SQL functions for XML or can these results be calculated with XML-methods?
Additionally, XML has some more features which concern saving ( and indexing ) and requesting 
(in particular with XQuery) in relational tables. These will also be demonstrated exemplary. 
The goal of the session is to show, when which language is of advantage in which case.

<h3>@Table vs #Table: шаблони використання, спільні характеристики, міфи</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>MS SQL Server надає дві можливості для зберігання тимчасових наборів даних: тимчасові табиці та табличні змінні.

<h3>Индексы в SQL Server. Сборник рецептов.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>В данном докладе я попытался объединить лучшие практики по использованию и обслуживанию индексов.
О чем будем говорить:
1. Кластерные, некластерные, фильтрованные индексы. Зачем они нужны, в каких случаях необходимо их создавать и какими они должны быть.
2. Как правильно писать запросы, чтобы не исключать возможности использования индексов.
3. Как правильно обслуживать индексы, чтобы не оказать SQL Server "медвежью услугу".

Будет мало текста -  будет, в основном,  демонстрация!

О чем не будем говорить:
1. XML, Columnstore индексы.
2. Внутренняя архитектура хранения индексов.</p>
