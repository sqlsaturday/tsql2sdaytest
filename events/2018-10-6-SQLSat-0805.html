<h3>The Road to The Autonomous Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Autonomous means capable of existing independently. Think maintenance free, self-healing, auto-tuning databases able to detect and automatically mitigate security risks. Sounds like impossible dream, but here is the best part - Azure is gradually making that next level of automation possible. Cloud economy of scale combined with unique features of Azure Sql PaaS resources transform and enhance the way we collect, store and process data. And that also affects our professional lives. Find out where we are on The Road to The Autonomous Databases, what are main building blocks, what kind of obstacles we still have to overcome and how to turn these challenges into opportunities.</p>

<h3>Azure SQL Database Managed Instance - Finally, SQL Server with None of the Headaches</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever since Azure SQL Database was released way back in 2010, if you wanted to get SQL Server as cloud managed database service, you had to accept some compromises. SQL Server's cloud-born cousin came with missing features and different ways of doing things, some of them better, others just different, and still others came with specific caveats. But now, with the introduction of Managed Instance, we might have finally found our database holy grail: full-on SQL Server, as a service, with none of the management headaches. Could it really be that simple? Come to this session and find out.</p>
