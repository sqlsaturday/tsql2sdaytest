<h3>Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting. You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting – a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more. When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems – and proving the changes worked. After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats, use them to zero in on performance issues, and solve a variety of problems affecting your databases. Stop guessing, start knowing!</p>

<h3>SQL Server Internals and Architecture</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:
What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems?
What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
How are queries handled behind the scenes?
What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
What happens during checkpoint</p>

<h3>Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy.  And it doesn’t mean that database administration on SQL Server is problem free.  And since SQL Server is constantly growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again.  In fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?  

This session will answer questions like:
What’s the most common Transact-SQL programming mistake and how do</p>

<h3>Back to basics - How does the Algebrizer work</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we’ll look at the operations and transformations of relational algebra in order to understand how query plans are computed.
Relational algebra represents the foundation of relational databases. Any valid SQL query is transformed after parsing into a parse tree in which the internal nodes are operators, leaves are relations (data sets) and subtrees are subexpressions. The primary goal of the query optimizer  is to transform query trees into equivalent expression trees, where the average size of the resultsets yielded by subexpressions in the tree are smaller than they were before the optimization. The query optimizer uses a set of rules, to generate equivalent parse trees and then applies proportional costs for operators and</p>

<h3>Creating a Metadata Mart w/ SSIS - Data Governance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture , via SSIS, that relys on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(developemnt effort) for generating the code required vs manual cosing. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts

<h3>Getting Started with MDX </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets. </p>

<h3>SQL Server Forensics: Tracking your users</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If your SQL Server was hacked, would you know? Would you know how to track down who attacked your SQL Server? What was compromised? When? How? Thankfully most DBAs are not fighting off criminals on a daily basis, but understanding SQL Server forensics will allow you to better understand your SQL Servers and will give you the ability to answer that frequent question “What happened?”  This session will walk you through the process of how to determine what happened on your server without the use of expensive third-party tools, using only features available in all editions of Windows and SQL Server.  You will learn how to parse the various Windows, SQL Server and database transaction logs.  We will also explore the wealth of information availab</p>

<h3>NoSQL- What is it and why do I care? </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>NoSQL (or, more correctly NoRel) is a moniker applied to a family of non relational software systems for storing data and/or documents that powers some of the largest sites on the internet.  Amazingly enough, some of these platforms have been around a very long time. A high level discussion of some of the pros and cons of this technology compared to traditional systems like Oracle and SQL Server.  A survey of the most popular "NoSQL" platforms and who uses them. </p>

<h3>Take Control of Your Databases with PBM!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A large majority of a modern DBA's workload consists of managing their policies and procedures to ensure that their systems are consistent and in many cases compliant with certain governmental requirements. SQL Server 2008 provides Policy Based Management (PBM) as a tool for the DBA to manage system policies in a very structured way. In this session, we will show you how to configure, monitor, and administer these features to help lower your anxiety levels while increasing your system’s availability. We'll also learn how you can leverage the PBM system across not only your 2008 environment but also all those down-level instances as well!</p>

<h3>Do More (ETL) with Less (Effort) - Automating SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks or packages that adhere to a pattern, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate package creation in SSIS, including the dynamic generation of data flows. We’ll cover some of the free and open source tools available for this, and discuss “roll your own” options.</p>
