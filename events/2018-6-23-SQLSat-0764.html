<h3>The Road to The Autonomous Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Autonomous means capable of existing independently. Think maintenance free, self-healing, auto-tuning databases able to detect and automatically mitigate security risks. Sounds like impossible dream, but here is the best part - Azure is gradually making that next level of automation possible. Cloud economy of scale combined with unique features of Azure PaaS resources transform and enhance the way we collect, store and process data. And that also affects our professional lives. Find out where we are on The Road to The Autonomous Databases, what are main building blocks, what kind of obstacles we still have to overcome and how to turn these challenges into opportunities.</p>

<h3>High availability for SQL Server using Azure as DR site</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will present the union of the local environment and the cloud and show the integration between these environments. The cloud is already a reality and we still have several environments that must remain in local environments due to legislation or company rules. In this session you will see that it is possible to maintain both environments.</p>

<h3>Score a (row) goal and beat a query optimizer</h3>

In this session we will have a deep look on cases where the query optimizer fails and explain why is it happening. Expect to see a real code written by real developers which will be tuned just in front of you to perform several times faster. If you want to (or possibly need to) take control of execution plan, this session is right for you!</p>
