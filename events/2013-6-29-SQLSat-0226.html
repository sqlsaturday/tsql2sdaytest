<h3>Into the Wild,Taming Unstructured Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is runaway growth in the data volumes many organizations are facing today. The bad news is that much of this data is unstructured which means your traditional RDBMS just isn't capability of helping you deal with it. As a result significant emphasis has been put on technologies like Hadoop, No SQL and other distributed databases which are better suited to handling unstructured data. With the latest release SQL Server 2012 however, Microsoft has provided new features which will help tame some of this unstructured data. This session will dive into the new FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search features. We will show you how they work and highlight real world examples for integrating these exciting new features into your organization.</p>

<h3>SSAS Tabular and PowerPivot - Choose Your Own Adve</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session I will cover how SSAS tabular and PowerPivot compliment each other and make the slicing and dicing of large amounts of data a breeze for Power Users. I will give a brief explanation and history of each, then will let the audience choose their own adventure in creating a SSAS tabular model or PowerPivot model from scratch. I will walk everyone through how to import data into it, create data relationships from a regular database model, then expose the elements from the model for users to slice and dice data with ease with a Pivot table then a Power View visualization.  I will demonstrate a few DAX commands that are very powerful yet very easy.

<h3>Changing Data Is Easy, Managing Data Change is Hard!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Databases are growing.  The way we use data is changing and growing.  When you have a lot of change, it has to be managed, or bad things happen to your data and your job!  A common problem with database change management is... database change management.  This session walks the user through the concepts of database change management, why it's important, and how SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) makes this process easy.  There are a lot of great features in this frequently overlooked product, and if you are not using it, your job is a lot harder than it needs to be.  Some things we will discuss: schema compare, database versions in source control, renaming objects, and how your job is pushing the button to deliver it the EASY way with SSDT.</p>

<h3>Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're on a coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office</p>

<h3>Putting Quality Back Into Your Data Analysis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session introduces Data Quality Services, a feature introduced in SQL Server 2012. One of the challenges in developing Business Intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data does not have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, and data duplication. Sometimes when consolidating data from more than one source you have to transform data to create one standard set of domain values in a standard format. SQL 2012 answers this need with Data Quality Services (DQS). In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data. You will see how to build a domain both manually and from an existing data table. You will then see how to use these domains to validate tables in SQL Server and Excel preparing them for use in SSAS and PowerPivot. After this session, you will understand how by putting quality back into your data, you can be your organization's BI hero.</p>

<h3>Implementing a HIPAA Compliance Strategy with SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>HIPAA puts a lot of responsibility on our companies and compliance can be hard to maintain. Today medical data is more valuable on the black market than a social security number or a credit card.  As DBAs we're charged with the security of our data and thus act as front line defense.

In this hour long session We'll delve into the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and what implications it has for us as data professionals. We'll discuss SQL Server best practices that can help protect ourselves, our company, and the people whom we serve. We'll also dive into features in SQL Server that can help in this endeavor. </p>

<h3>Code Paradigms in BIDS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using BIDS we are able to answer questions in two contradictory worlds the OLTP and the OLAP in order to do that BIDS is presented with the three services SSIS, SSRS and SSAS and a variety of languages such as SQL, T-SQL, MDX, DMX, etc.
It is impossible to explain even one aspect of one of the tools that comprise BIDS (Database Tools) even less to explain the main components of the MS BI stack SSIS, SSAS, SSRS in a single presentation. So in this presentation we are trying to explain the mind set of these three services and paradigms from the perspective of the problems they are trying to solve.

<h3>SQL Server 2012 ColumnStore Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>	Come and learn how the new SQL Server 2012 feature, ColumnStore Indexes, can parallelize your Data Warehouse aggregations. I will be doing a deep dive into the inner workings of ColumnStore indexes; how they work, key characteristics, dos and don'ts, restrictions, and more. I will have some insight into how CSI's will work in SQL Server vNext, as well.
	If you are a production DBA who needs to find out more about some of the additional hot features that have been included with CSI's, like batch mode processing and data segments, then this session is for you. If you are a BI DBA or developer who needs to find out how CSI's can increase the performance of your aggregations and star-joins by up to 40 times, then this session is also for you.

<h3>Building a SQL Server for Optimal Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do SQL Server Administrators or Developers really know how to configure the hard- and software components of a SQL Server in order to have it running at peak performance ? This is not their fault and is purely due to the fact that they have not been exposed to these options before. If you are a DBA or developer and find yourself wondering how hardware changes affect a system or have questions relating to the performance implications of partitioning or compression, then this session is for you. In this session, I will be exploring topics such as Memory configuration, CPU and cache options, IO considerations, partitioning, compression and database file placement and many other performance optimisation tricks.

<h3>Introducing Cube World To Users From Flat Table Land</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session explores the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for those DBAs and developers who are more comfortable working with relational databases than cubes. Starting with a ‘normal’ relational database, the attendee will learn how to build a basic model by loading data from several data sources, establish relations between these data sources, define measures and dimensions, build hierarchies, create KPIs and deploy functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with their data. For users already familiar with PowerPivot, this session provides a good transition into the world of SSAS as both use essentially the same techniques.</p>

<h3>AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.</p>

<h3>A Balanced BI Approach (Self-Service  Corporate)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session I will cover how PowerPivot and BISM Tabular complement each other in the domains of self-service and corporate BI. Let's face it, The Finance department does not have the expertise to model a database for reporting, and IT doesn't have the expertise in advanced financial calculations that the executive team is interested in. To bridge the gap from a large requirements process with the risk of functionality lost in translation, I will show you how you can roll out a PowerPivot model for business units in your organization and when it makes sense to centralize it in a BISM Tabular model.</p>
