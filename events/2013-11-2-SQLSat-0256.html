<h3>Disabling xp_CmdShell - Is it really a best practice?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the most recommended "best practices" there is is to disable xp_CmdShell.  Whether you're pro, con, or just a casual user of xp_CmdShell, the first part of this "Black Arts" session will show you why disabling xp_CmdShell might actually be a bad idea depending on what else you do or don't do.  Then, for those folks that have made the extremely grave security mistake of giving users or apps the privs to run xp_CmdShell directly, you'll learn how to use a very simple method to allow the users/apps to use stored procedures that run xp_CmdShell without them having the privs to run xp_CmdShell directly themselves in a much more secure manner and all without certificates!.  If time allows, we'll also learn a method to greatly simplify PowerShell inputs to a table from T-SQL using only a single extra connection instead of two.

<h3>Temporary Objects Without Permanent Consequences</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Temporary objects like Table Variables and Temporary Tables are not inherently bad, but they are overused and misunderstood by many. Increase your understanding and learn when you should favor a Temporary Table over a Table Variable. We will start with the basics, but also look at execution plans to get a better grasp on the cause of those performance differences. Table-Valued Parameters are implemented as read-only Temporary Tables under the covers, and have some solid use cases. Discover how Table-Valued Parameters can be used to: 1) avoid the dynamic sql used by application code (or t-sql string splitting functions) to allow multi-value selection and 2) dramatically reduce the number of round trips between an application and SQL Server. </p>

<h3>Maximizing the Data Exploration Capabilities of Power View</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Would business users in your organization love to get their hands on an interactive, visually-oriented, data exploration tool? If so, Power View may be a useful addition to your BI environment to handle certain types of self-service reporting requirements. In this session we will demonstrate the features and functionality of Power View including highlighting, cross-filtering, play axis, small multiples, tiles, cards, maps, filtering, and exporting.

We will identify which situations Power View is most suited for, as well as its strengths and limitations. Capabilities in SharePoint 2010/2013 vs. Excel 2013 will be reviewed, as well as restrictions on types of data sources allowed. We will also discuss how to prepare a dataset in order to maximize the usability and functionality of Power View. </p>

<h3>A World Where All Data Has a Place to Live:  Centralizing Distributed Reference Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever started work on a project only to find that one of your key reference datasets is only available in a spreadsheet on somebody's desktop?  Even worse, you've probably run into situations where key data elements are 'common knowledge' amongst the business users, but don't even exist in a spreadsheet.  

Take heart.   Using Master Data Services (MDS) we now have an effective solution to this problem that has plagued IT for years, without having to create a custom solution.  In this session you will learn the basics of MDS, and how it can be used to easily create a home for the homeless data on your latest project.  Also, learn how Data Quality Services integration can be used to detect duplicate records, and perform cleansing operations.

Don't get hung up trying to build a custom solution to house homeless reference data during your next project.  Join this session and learn how to use MDS so you can deliver your project on time and on budget.</p>

<h3>T-SQL: Simple Changes That Go a Long Way</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Writing TSQL that performs well requires knowledge beyond proper syntax, sometimes it requires more than just knowing TSQL, and sometimes it takes a bit of rework and ingenuity. There are simple things that you will learn in this session that will improve the performance of your queries. Learn about indexing techniques and reading execution plans to see if the optimizer is using the index. Performance isn't everything though. There are small things you can do to make your TSQL more maintainable too. We will dive into a few TSQL tricks with Common Table Expressions, Table-Valued Parameters, and COALESCE.</p>

<h3>Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</p>

<h3>Windows Azure SQL Database Design: Silver Lining and Dark Side</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data modelers and designers need to understand the logical, physical, and technical differences in designing for Windows Azure SQL Databases (WASDs) and traditional on-premise SQL Server databases. In this session, we'll review the concepts that still work in both and the features that need to be tailored to each target environment.

You’ll see demonstrations of the database design processes and gain best practices for model-driven development for each environment, including tool support. We’ll finish up with 5 tips for designing databases for both WASD and SQL Server.</p>

<h3>T-SQL : Bad Habits  Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Bad habits: we all have them. SELECT * is the obvious one; but in this session you will learn about various other habits and why they can be bad for performance or maintainability. You will also learn about best practices that will help you avoid falling into some of these bad habits. Come learn how these habits develop, what kind of problems they can lead to, and how you can avoid them - leading to more efficient code, a more productive work environment, and - in a lot of cases – both.</p>

<h3>Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.</p>

<h3>Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.</p>
