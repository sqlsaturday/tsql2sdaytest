<h3>Azure Data Lake - The Services. The SQL. The Sharp.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do we implement Azure Data Lake?
How does a lake fit into our data platform architecture? Is Data Lake going to run in isolation or be part of a larger pipeline?
How do we use and work with USQL?
Does size matter?!
 
The answers to all these questions and more in this session as we immerse ourselves in the lake, that’s in a cloud.
 
We'll take an end to end look at the components and understand why the compute and storage are separate services.
 
For the developers, what tools should we be using and where should we deploy our USQL scripts. Also, what options are available for handling our C# code behind and supporting assemblies.

We’ll cover everything you need to know to get started developing data solutions with Azure Data Lake.</p>

<h3>A lazy data scientist's toolkit</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The client has some burning business questions and you have the client's data. So which tools will help you to understand that data and tell your client something they did not know already?  In this session, I'll take you through my personal choice, demo each of them and explain their value.  These include Excel; Tableau; R and RStudio and my favourite packages; Power BI and especially the fabulous Query Editor; SQL; cubes and Azure Machine Learning.  

I will also demo the tools I expect to  be using soon as my projects propel me into the new world of Azure cloud and big data, of Spark and Hadoop.  I hope to show "plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose" and that old friends such as R and SQL are also useful in this new world.</p>

<h3>Effective Unit Testing for SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are tools available from Microsoft, as well as from a number of third party vendors, to ease the process of integrating database unit testing into your development environments and your continuous delivery pipeline.

This session isn't about any of those tools, but is an attempt to get back to basics - with the open source tSQLt framework - and address questions such as 

 Why is database unit testing difficult?
 What do I need to test?
 What do I not need to test?
What does a "good" unit test look like?
What tests should I be writing anwyay?

This session will incorporate real-life experiences with tSQLt, as well as lessons that can be learned from other testing framworks and other programming languages.</p>

<h3>Exploring Dark Data with SQL Server 2016 and R [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the addition of R into SQL Server 2016, Microsoft have provided a few extra degrees of freedom for the standard SQL developer. You can now use the R language to wrangle, clean and collect external data, using libraries and functionality that simply wasn’t available to you before with regular T-SQL. Performing data enrichment at scale with SQL Server or even Microsoft R Server can provide extremely valuable new insights for your clients and start reaping the benefits of big data.
     
In this session, Consolidata’s Oliver Frost shows you how to develop your own application for tapping into ‘dark data’. Ollie will demonstrate how to stream live tweets, perform aggregations in R and pipe the output to a Power BI dashboard, giving you a full end-to-end experience of the importance of learning some basic R code in 2016. 
     
This session is for anyone who is new to R and is interesting expanding their skill set beyond their comfort zone in SQL Server.</p>

<h3>What to do before your Power BI report starts getting slow</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When building a report or dashboard in Power BI and using DirectQuery or Live connection it is important to take into account what will happen when reports are being adopted by the business and the audience grows.

Working with IT there is nothing worse when the business starts complaining. During this session I will show you how to approach the situation when the business already started complaining, what the most common pains appear and where you should be looking before the performance starts degrading. 

We will be looking into measuring different timings, what is important when building reports,  investigating logs and what options you have to this in a structured fashion.</p>

<h3>Administrating SQL Server with PowerShell dbatools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let me show you how easy it is to use PowerShell to accomplish many everyday tasks straight from the command line with the community developed module dbatools.

Afraid of PowerShell? 
Worried its too complicated?
Don't want to go through the learning curve?

Let me show you with plenty of demos how easy and straight forward it can be and I will save you time starting Monday

Want to restore an entire servers databases to the latest available point in time of the backups in just one line?
Be useful to know the Last DBCC Check for your entire estate in only one line of code?
Need to test your restores but its complicated?
and many many more
All this in a fast paced, fun session</p>

<h3>JSON before and after SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The JavaScript Object Notation format, known simply as JSON, has now become a standard in data interchange between client-server applications, it is also used to store information in non-relational databases and the SQL Server 2016 engine handles it natively . However, today, not everyone has passed to the latest version of SQL Server, however, it is possible to process the JSON format even with earlier versions: in this session, it is confident with this format and illustrates the non-native mode that allows you to be ready in the moment of the upgrade to 2016 (or later) with a few simple moves. Finally, with a few simple examples, you will find some tips on how to use JSON in an advanced way with SQL Server 2016.</p>

<h3>Understand the Transaction Log, Unlock Greater Throughput</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Does your application suffer from performance problems even though you followed best practices on schema design? Have you looked at your transaction log? 
There's no doubt about it, the transaction log is treated like a poor cousin. The poor thing does not receive much love. The transaction log, however, is a very essential and misunderstood part of your database. There will be a team of developers creating an absolutely awesome elegant design the likes of which have never been seen before, but the leave the transaction log using default settings. It's as if it doesn't matter, an afterthought, a relic of the platform architecture.
In this session, you will learn to appreciate how the transaction log works and how you can improve the performance of your applications by making the right architectural choices.</p>

<h3>Teaching the IT Pro how to Dev - PowerShell, Source Control  Unit Testing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will look at how IT Pros (and developers) *could* be completing their day to day tasks in a more efficient manner with effective Unit Testing and Source Control of their Scripts.

This is a session where there will be chance to follow along (if you bring your own laptop) and learn in real time from the co-ordinator of the UK PowerShell User Groups - however you will also be lead to further community resources if you require further time after the session to get this built into your current day to day workflow.

As this session will be focused towards SQL Professionals we will take a look at SQL Specifics that can be used within PowerShell Scripts  Unit Testing.</p>

<h3>Database version control and deployment: model or migration scripts?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For the last few years Microsoft have been promoting declarative, model-based database development with tools like SSDT. For many this is the way forward – gone are the days of managing endless upgrade scripts and manual deployments. 

At the same time, leaders and shakers of our industry including Jez Humble, Pramod Sadalge and Paul Stovell promote an iterative, migration script driven approach asserting that deployment scripts should be tested early and not generated by a tool. 

I'm irritated whenever I go to a “how to do database continuous delivery” session and the speaker presents one way as good and the other as bad. Like most things, it depends.

I’ll illustrate the limitations of each approach with a simple scenario. I’ll describe which projects are better suited to a model or a migrations approach, and whether it’s possible to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<h3>Enhancing relational models with graph processing In SQL Server 2017.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Analysing highly connected data using SQL is hard! Relational databases were simply not designed  to handle this,  but graph databases were.  Built from the ground up to understand interconnectivity, graph databases enable a flexible performant way to analyse relationships, and one has just landed in SQL Server 2017! SQL  Server supports two new table types NODE and EDGE and a new function MATCH, which enables deeper exploration of the relationships in your data than ever before. 

In this session, we seek to explore, what is a graph database, why you should be interested, what query patterns does they solve and how does SQL Server compare with competitors. We will explore each of these based on real data shredded from IMDB.</p>

<h3>Getting started with Powershell for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you spend your day running the same routine tasks?  Does it irk you when you do the same thing more than once?  I (sadly) still have to answer yes to one of those questions.  However, whilst I do still carry out some of the same routine tasks, learning Powershell has enabled me to automate the majority.
The potential for automation that Powershell brings, can have a huge impact on regaining precious time for a busy DBA.  The ability to create a codebase of cmdlets that sits outside your SQL Server instances allows you to introduce easy frameworks for standardisation, inventory collection and access to external processes that would be clunky in SSIS or require using the dreaded xp_cmdshell.
In this presentation, I’m going to demonstrate some of the features I use to make my life easier, from the basics of creating a Powershell profile and how different objects and inbuilt cmdlets work, to creating my own cmdlets and modules.</p>

<h3>Always On Multi-Site Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Building robust and resilient Data Platform solutions can be complex and costly, building out for both High Availability and Disaster Recovery. The Always On technologies incorporated in the Microsoft SQL Server stack help Data Platform Engineers to do just this. Creating solutions that span multiple locations, in an effort to protect the data that we are tasked to manage on a daily basis.

Together we will walk through the architecture patterns, technology requirements, and configuration options that you need to know in order to build a solid Data Platform. Understanding the implementation differences between on-premises and cloud based deployments is important. Especially as there are specific requirements that need to be met for up-time SLAs to be applicable, as well as mitigating for region failures.

All of these elements mean that it is more than just simple wizards to follow in order to have a solid, reliable, and robust SQL Server Data Platform.</p>

<h3>SQLOS Scheduling From the Inside</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQLOS scheduler has been a core feature of SQL Server ever since its appearance as the User Mode Scheduler in version 7.0. In this session you will learn what makes it tick, where lines of responsibility are drawn between schedulers, workers and tasks, and how everybody has their own selfish ideas about fairness.

We'll pay particular attention to synchronisation: the need to synchronise, the balancing act between busy waiting and context switching, and examples of internal SQLOS synchronisation primitives. All of this will complement your existing mental model of SQL Server waits.

It is a deep session, but not a broad one. As long as you have an interest in either SQL Server or operating system internals, no specific background knowledge is assumed - we will build from the ground up.</p>

<h3>What is DevOps?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We believe if you are in a competitive market, the companies that have a DevOps culture will have the best chance of succeeding.  But what is a DevOps Culture?
 
DevOps is one of those terms that has transcended its initial use.
You still see people talk about being DevOps Engineer or do DevOps for SQL, but you also hear about a company being a DevOps company, having a DevOps Culture. What does it all mean?
In this talk we will discuss and probably argue what DevOps is and isn't. I'll put forward what we consider a DevOps culture, what are the core elements, who does what and importantly what breaks it.
 
You will gain an understanding of why companies with such a culture can get solutions to market quicker and can respond to changes better than their competition.</p>

<h3>An Artistic Dimwit Learns Data Visualisation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowERBI goes Bananas

I'm scared of visualisations and I wanted to fix it. This is a talk by an artistic dimwit who is quite good at data.  

With a Trello-based Kanban board* as my muse and PowerBI as my canvass, I built a series of progressively less bad visualisations until I felt like an artist.

As with all art, you be the judge.
