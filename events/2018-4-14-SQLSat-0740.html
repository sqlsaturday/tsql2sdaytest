<h3>Well, actually...  How to not be THAT guy in IT</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Unless you've been in a cave, you've seen articles lately on what it's like to be a woman in tech. In 2017, waves of blogs and news articles tell us about those extreme examples of misogyny. Only they aren't fringe, one-off stories.  It's happening to women you know.
IT can be an inhospitable place for women. Some call it a "bro-grammer" culture. Compared to men, women are leaving IT at 2.5x and are interrupted 3x as often. Our credentials are called into question.  We're called emotional or aggressive. We have our own job explained to us. Sometimes its subtle.  Other times it's overt. There's always that one guy who ruins it for the rest of you. 
It doesn't have to be that way.  Most of the guys we work with are stand-up, respectable WIT allies.  The problem is, you don't always notice when it happens.  Learn what those subtle forms of sexism look like at work.  Learn how you can stop that guy in his tracks.  Learn how to not BE that guy, even when you're just trying to help.</p>

<h3>Stop Wasting Valuable Time and Resources - Performance Tune Your Jobs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We all know that execution plans and indexes are important pieces to performance tuning jobs. However, they are definitely not the only tools in the toolbox. This session will take a more high-level, holistic, approach to performance tuning jobs and their components. We will talk about where to start, how to identify problem areas, and many ways to improve performance. Many of the topics covered in the presentation come from real-world situations I've encountered. One example describes how we stopped a job after 13 hours and were able to tune it down to 8 minutes. Adding additional hardware is not always an option or the answer. Do more with what you have and tune your jobs. I'll show you how.</p>

<h3>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Understanding Index internal operation is very important.
It is a fundamental knowledge of performance tuning and troubleshooting.
However, Index internal seems very hard to understand because many materials explain it a very complicated way.

This presentation covers from basic concept of index to all of internal index structure.
I will explain the index structure very simple concept.
Therefore, all developer who attends this session could understand how index work with a Clustered index and a Non-clustered index together.
Furthermore, this presentation will share very important tip how to troubleshooting index issue.
This presentation would very help not only who does not know index but also, who know very well index internal.</p>

<h3>Performance Troubleshooting made easier - new features in Management Studio !</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools.  Which enabled rapid enhancement to Execution Plan.  

Do you know that you can now see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for the operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for an execution and what trace flags were active during compilation and which ones influenced compilation? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for table name, index name or column name without opening XML plan? When you see a clustered index was used do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows? 

In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan.  You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Catalog – Turning Unused Assets into Usable Knowledge</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is today’s currency. Azure Data Catalog (ADC) is a relatively unknown resource in the IT community.  This is an unfortunate state since ADC is an incredibly useful tool that is easy to implement and use. Companies that are able to leverage their data have seen the greatest gains in growth and market capitalization.  The reason for this is simple: We live in the information age.  Being able to leverage the data you gather is the invitation you need just to compete in information age.
ADC is an indispensable tool that helps companies organize and make sense of the mountains of data they collect every day.  By walking participants through an implementation of ADC, I will introduce them to the product, and show how easy it is to use.  By presenting concrete examples of how ADC is used, I will demonstrate its importance. Participants should leave this session determined to introduce ADC to their team and resolute in their intention to implement it within their company.</p>

<h3>Python in SQL Server 2017</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2017 has finally arrived, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!</p>

<h3>Azure Automation: Your SQL Agent in the Cloud</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You want to migrate your on premise SQL Database to cloud, and soon recognize that SQL Agent is not available.  You heard the promise of spinning up databases on demand and turn off/dial down when not in use. Do you want to do this manually each time?  Azure Automation comes to rescue.  It is a service for simplifying cloud management. Using Azure Automation long-running, manual, error-prone, and frequently repeated tasks can be automated to increase reliability, efficiency, and time to value for your organization.
In this demo intensive session I will show you how to setup Azure Automation, walk you through a runbook example (a compilation of routine procedures and operations), execute runbook on demand and also show how to schedule the same.  At the end of this session you will have solid understanding about how to automate Azure services including replacing SQL Agent functionality using Azure automation, and conveniently encapsulate within the common Azure portal experience.</p>

<h3>Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices in Technology</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.</p>

<h3>The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. SQL Server 2016 introduces a number of new functions and methods that directly impact how you’re going to do query tuning in the future. The most important change is the introduction of the Query Store. 

This session will explore how the Query Store works and how it’s going to change the methods you use to tune and troubleshoot query performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but you’ll know everything you need in order to put it to work with your own SQL Server 2016 tuning efforts, as well as your Azure SQL Databases.</p>

<h3>New SQL Server 2016 Security Features for Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SQL Server 2016, the database engine has been greatly enhanced for security, with three new features that you’ll learn about in this demo-packed session. With dynamic data masking (DDM), you can fully or partially conceal sensitive columns from query results. Masking does not modify data on in the table, it simply hides data from users that don’t have permission to see it. Row-level security (RLS) also hides data from unauthorized users, but at the row level. With RLS, you can create your own security policy to control which users can read or write specific rows in the table. Finally, Always Encrypted (AE) uses client-side encryption to ensure that data is encrypted in flight, not just at rest. Furthermore, the encryption keys are accessible only to the client. This guarantees that data cannot be decrypted on the server, easing the migration path to the cloud for users with highly sensitive data.</p>

<h3>Transforming Your Brain with SQL 2017 with Linux</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>By now, most of us heard of SQL on Linux when it was first released.  It was also on the announcement of  SQL 2017 which caught most of us by surprise, being that SQL 2016 was just released 16 months prior.  Most of us were still using SQL 2008 and barely getting our organizations to adopt SQL 2012.  The IT infrastructure we serve today probably wouldn't benefit from Linux since most of our servers are tightly woven with the Microsoft platform solution.  So why bother learning SQL 2017 on Linux?  Attend this session to find valuable lessons for every data professional should know whether Linux or Windows.</p>

<h3>It's Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016/17</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system-maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.</p>

<h3>CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</p>

<h3>Reporting Services 2016: New Features  Smart Migration Strategy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SQL Server 2016, Reporting Services finally got some love!  In this session, you will get an overview of some of the new features and functionality in SSRS 2016: A look at the new Report Manager interface, Mobile reports, KPIS and the new control we have over the placement of parameters.  We will also look at the new Mobile Report Publisher app and see how easy it is to take an existing report and make it mobile friendly.

The session will then dive into how to use the data in the ReportServer database tables to see which reports in your environment are being used and how well they are performing.  With this understanding you can determine which reports, data sets and data sources to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  Come see how to leverage PowerShell to extract the reports from the database, instead of having to download them from Report Manager, to facilitate an easy migration to a new SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services implementation.</p>

<h3>RedGate: Extending DevOps to SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition. Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck. Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver. Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.</p>

<h3>Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.</p>

<h3>SQL Solutions Group: The DBA Is Dead.  Long Live the Remote DBA.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the rate of change in the industry has accelerated exponentially and the always fluid role of a DBA  has morphed to the point where many organizations don’t even have the role anymore or it is combined with other duties.  What does this mean for the DBA?  For developers?  For organizations?   While we certainly don’t have all the answers, we’ve been doing this for a very long time and have seen lots of trends and buzzwords come and go.  This session will be a fun and open discussion on these trends and how outsourcing the mundane so your key people can focus on the highest value activities may be the best way to go for many organizations.</p>

<h3>Azure Infrastructure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll review all the various infrastructure components that make up the Microsoft Azure platform. When it comes to moving SQL Server systems into the Azure platform having a solid understanding of the Azure infrastructure will make migrations successful and making support solutions much easier.
 
Designing your Azure infrastructure properly from the beginning is extremely important. An improperly designed and configured infrastructure will provide performance problems, manageability problems, and can be difficult to resolve without downtime.
 
As Azure scales around the world many more companies, no matter where they are located, will be begin moving services from on-premises data centers into the Azure Cloud, and a solid foundation is key to successful migrations.</p>

<h3>Dell: #GetModern with Dell EMC</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Consistent and predictable performance is critical for any successful deployment of Microsoft SQL Server. All-Flash arrays have been available for years and sub-millisecond response times should be the expectation. Maximize the performance and agility of your environment and learn how to automate and leverage self-service for snapshots of your databases for protection and re-purposing. Test/dev infrastructures can be refreshed from production DBs in minutes rather than hours or days. Stop working harder and slower than you need to be, learn how you can leverage Dell EMC. Whether storage, servers, networking, data protection, converged or hyper-converged…  we have you covered.</p>

<h3>Storage For the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.</p>

<h3>But it worked great in Dev! Perfomance for Devs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, execution plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.</p>
