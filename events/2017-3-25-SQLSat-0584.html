<h3>Mobile, Paginated, KPIs, and Power BI, Oh My! SSRS 2016 Reporting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2016 is getting the biggest update since SQL Server 2005! This session will define and demo each of the SSRS report types are and how they are developed and supported: Mobile (previously DataZen reports), Paginated (SSRS RDL reports), KPIs (new standalone Key Performance Indicators), and Power BI (now Power BI can be managed in SSRS for an on-premises solution). All of these report types can now be managed in SSRS for a single reporting solution.

We will also look at the new SSRS Web Portal (replacement for Report Manager) and how the development environment will change as well. Sometime will also be spent on how to support all of these report types and the impact it will have on IT.
If you have been curious about what has changed with SSRS in SQL Server 2016 and you want to be ahead of the curve, this is the session for you!</p>

<h3>Accelerating DevOps and TDM Using Data Virtualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is the merger of app development, testing, and IT ops.  All tasks from coding to testing to operations must be automated so that new features and fixes can be continuously delivered.

Test Data Management (TDM) is the optimization of the process of software quality, ensuring that applications properly work according to their specifications.

Constraining both DevOps and TDM is data, which has grown enormous and complex. "Storage is cheap" is not merely a lie, but beside the point. It takes a lot of time to push terabytes around from place to place, and time is expensive.

Provisioning a full environment for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each might require terabytes of storage. So, everyone is limited to working in a small shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, and code quality suffers, and the pace of delivery fails to live up to requirements.

Data virtualization is the solution.  Come learn.</p>

<h3>Seeking the Perfect Hybrid:  On-Prem Data with Reports and Dashboards in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For many new Power BI implementations, initial self-service and team objectives are soon met, and the natural evolution of Power BI turns to an organizational focus.  In other scenarios, the enterprise seeks to preserve its investments in "classic BI" by integrating Power BI with Analysis Services and the underlying data warehouse.

In this session, Data Platform (SQL Server / BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson explores the construction of organizational BI solutions, wedding the "traditional" solutions with the reporting and analysis power of Power BI.  We'll focus upon the components of a "traditional" solution, up to the semantic model (with SQL Server Analysis Services as an example), and then explore paths to the implementation of an end-to-end enterprise solution that uses Power BI as the presentation layer.
This session applies, in most respects, to Analysis Services 2012 and above.</p>

<h3>The Next Frontier-  Opportunities When Migrating to the Cloud with Virtualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cloud is everywhere and the database administrator is caught in the middle. How do you know where to start and what to migrate first? How do you perform consolidation planning and ensure data security? This session builds on a full demonstration, along with tips and tricks to show how the DBA can secure their environment to allow a self-service option so they no longer are the constraints to projects! The attendee will leave with a clear understanding of:
* Principles of virtualization and why itâ€™s the answer to so many challenges we face today.
* How easy it is to secure data in the cloud using data masking features.
* The ease of connecting to the cloud and migrating environments.
* How to troubleshoot when issues arise and the tools available to diagnose issues.</p>

<h3>Power BI on  Azure Analysis Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The level of effort to integrate a tabular SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cube with Power BI became significantly easier with the release of Azure Analysis Services. Setup, configuration and maintenance of an On Premise gateway for direct query and scheduled data refreshes is no longer required. Leveraging the default Azure Analysis Services integration with Power BI, developers can focus on modeling cubes and creating beautiful dashboards and reports. In this session, we will explore the setup of an Azure Analysis Services as compared to the use of as an On Premise Analysis Services data source for Power BI. 

We will discuss modeling  security patterns in Analysis Services in conjunction with Power BI. We will also demonstrate a direct query connection of On Premise and Azure Analysis Services cubes to Power BI. Additionally, we will highlight leveraging Power BI functionality including reports, dashboards, and QA of an Analysis Services data set.</p>

<h3>Data Integration: the neglected hero of your information environment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every organization struggles to ensure data is up to date and consistent across multiple systems.   Often this results in the development of layers of system to system data integrations or repetitive and manual processes intended to support operational and reporting needs.

Enterprise Data Warehouses and Marts are often the only stores that provide single point access to data sourced from multiple systems - but these stores can be expensive and complicated to build and maintain and tend to lag behind business need.

Data Lakes offer the promise of fast inexpensive data acquisition but without specialized tools lack the structure that makes their data accessible and useful to the business.

A managed Data Integration platform can provide both efficient data management across systems and a shared, single point, store of data sourced from all participating systems.   A Data Integration platform solution is not technology or tool specific and can provide immediate and continuing value.</p>

<h3>Get Into the Goldilocks Zone: Managing SQL Transaction Log VLF Growth</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are your transaction logs ballooning? Are the VLF numbers out of control? What can you do about it? 

Let's start with "what's a VLF and why do I care?" and move forward into learning how to shrink VLFs (a temporary solution) and how to resize SQL Server transaction log files (a more permanent solution) for greater server stability, better performance during server startup, backups, and restores, and to minimize storage space requirements.

The SQL Server transaction log is a critical piece of SQL Server's ability to ensure that data is maintained exactly as the user input or modified the data. The transaction log must, at times, grow in size in order to do its job. When a transaction logâ€™s growth gets out of control (too large, too many segments), then SQL Serverâ€™s ability to perform as it should is negatively impacted. Too-large transaction log files cause longer database start up, backup and restore times, and will require more storage space on disk. Learn how to control VLF gro</p>

<h3>Statistics and New Cardinality Estimator Model</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Statistics in SQL Server plays a major role creating execution plan which essentially decides server performance. If you get a good execution plan the server performance is good otherwise it will impact negatively on the server performance. SQL Server 2014 introduced new Cardinality Estimation (CE) model to improve the quality of the execution plans via quality estimates of row counts. The new CE model is a major redesign to the Query Optimizer since SQL Server 7.0. In this session, I'm going to talk about how statistics is used to generate the execution plan, how execution plan changes with new CE model with demos.</p>

<h3>Introduction To Azure DocumentDB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Developers are interested in consuming and processing very large amounts of data as quickly as possible. Microsoft Azure DocumentDB is a NoSQL document database service designed for modern mobile and web applications which require fast reads and writes of unstructured data feeds. Azure DocumentDB natively supports JSON documents which is a key performance feature. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to create a DocumentDB instance in Azure, how to work with JSON documents, create Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax, create application logic as stored procedures, triggers and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript. Finally, I will compare performance and feature difference between SQL Server 2016 and Azure DocumentDB.</p>

<h3>Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We've all been told at some point that heaps are usually bad for select, update, and delete performance. But how bad are they really? Can they also be problematic for inserts? Are they ever a good idea? For this installment of Rick's "Weird Stuff" series we will take a closer look at why heaps can cause issues and maybe see a deadlock or two.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Data Science with R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Science is the gaining popularity but what does it really mean? 
Discovering useful patterns and insight in the enterprise has become more challenging without a new set of tools. Big data has taken center stage in the data warehouse community and with data sets so large and complex that traditional data processing applications are becoming inadequate. Learn about the R language that is at the center of most advanced analytics conversations. R is an open source statistical language that is rapidly gaining popularity due to a robust set of machine learning functionality and a never-ending set of R packages that are used to increase functionality of the core R language.
In this session, we will introduce the R language and review some of the features of the highly interactive environment that are available with just the base install. We will also review some of the upcoming features in the SQL Server 2016.</p>
