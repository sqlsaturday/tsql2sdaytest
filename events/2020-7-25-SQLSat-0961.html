<h3>Networking 101: Building professional relationships</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Networking. You keep hearing that word throughout your career development, but you don’t know much about it, much less, how to do it. You want to connect with technical and data professionals, so you attend events such as SQL Saturday and your local user group. But what about your book club, your gym, your church group, or your kid’s soccer game? Those are prime — and overlooked — opportunities to network!

In this interactive session, we will discuss networking — what it is, why it’s important, and where opportunities exist. You will even have an opportunity to practice networking within the confines of our room. You might even leave this session with new networking contacts that you didn’t previously have!  Bring business cards if you have them!</p>

<h3>Keys to a Healthy Relationship with SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Developers and DBAs have had a long, sometimes strained relationship. Some developers see DBAs as roadblocks standing in the way of getting their work shipped; some DBAs see developers as agents of chaos bent on ruining their perfect database environments.

In this talk designed for application and database developers, we’ll talk about why SQL Server behaves the way it does, common database and query design pain points, and how we look for them. With real-world examples and tales of troublesome T-SQL, past and present, you’ll start to get a picture of what to do and not to do in your applications. Along the way, you’ll learn how to build a better relationship with both SQL Server and the DBAs responsible for it.</p>

<h3>Need to Monitor Any Azure Resource? Must Learn Kusto Query Language</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Kusto is a service for storing and running interactive analytics over Big Data, easy to query using Kusto Query Language (KQL). As we make progress in our migration to the cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella of ‘Azure Monitor.’ Whether you are ‘detecting and diagnose issues across applications,’ ‘correlate infrastructure issues for VMs,’ ‘drill into your SQL database monitoring data with Log Analytics,’ you will be using ‘Azure Monitor.’ Azure Monitor uses a version of the KQL that is suitable for simple log queries but also includes advanced functionality such as aggregations, joins, and smart analytics. Going forward, KQL must be your primary resource for querying the Azure Monitor log.

In this 95% demo session, I will show you some ‘getting started’ tips and a few sophisticated queries using KQL. Come and learn about the future of monitoring and investigations of Azure services.</p>

<h3>Graph Databases–How and Why</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We, as data professionals, are dealing with increasingly large amounts of data. And, increasingly, we're asked to generate insights from this data. For that, the relationships between data points matter more than simple aggregations of individual data points. In our interconnected world, interconnected businesses, interconnected applications, graph databases lend themselves to answering relationship questions far more easily than...relational databases.

In this session we'll look at graph databases for
	how to model graph databases
	how to easily express relationships between interconnected data
	how to efficiently retrieve interrelated data 

We'll look at the MATCH predicate in T-SQL and the MATCH statement in Cypher, the query language for Neo4j.</p>

<h3>A Practical Starter Guide to SQL Notebooks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you been hearing about SQL Notebooks in Azure Data Studio but haven't worked with them yet? Or have you played around with notebooks but not been able to figure out how to make them work for you?

Let's jump into SQL Notebooks together as we figure out how we can use them in our day-to-day work! We will start by looking at the different options that are available to us in SQL Notebooks. Then we will examine real world scenarios and create notebooks for them. Finally, we will learn how we can share the notebooks with our coworkers.

When you leave, you will have the practical knowledge and comfort level to use SQL Notebooks in your day-to-day work.</p>

<h3>Modern SQL Server CPU Architectures for Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, public cloud CPU selection, and SQL Server instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers for both on-prem and cloud-based SQL Servers.</p>

<h3>10 DBA Tasks for Azure SQL: Whats Different from On-Prem</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Adoption of Cloud is at an all time high, with no end in sight. Managing a small fleet of databases on-premises was something you used to understand. In this session, we'll cover the 10 most common tasks a DBA needs to learn to manage in Azure SQL as well as they currently manage their On Prem installs. One of the great things about Azure SQL is that the skill set your team has developed over the years translates well. The tools and technologies you're familiar with are all there. So much is the same but some of the tasks that DBAs do are different.</p>

<h3>So you want to Present: Tips and Tricks of the trade</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you've decided to take the leap into presenting. Maybe it's at your local user group, maybe it's at SQL Saturday. This talk will guide you through the process of selecting a topic, preparing for it and actually giving it. We'll talk about what can go wrong and how to handle that. We'll also talk about what can be done to prevent something from going wrong in the first place. What are some good guidelines to follow and when can, or even should, you break them. This will be partly interactive so come with questions and be prepared to be asked some.</p>

<h3>Window Functions in SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>No, they don't have anything to do with the operating by the same name. Instead, window functions allow us to calculate a single value based on a set of rows, and we have extraordinary control over which rows get used as the inputs. We'll start by covering what a window function is and will discuss the syntax and usage of the OVER clause in detail.  We will also cover the three classes of window functions (ranking, aggregate and analytic) with focus on some commonly used functions as well some "gotchas" with some of these functions. You will learn how this class of functions can help you write more performant code.</p>
