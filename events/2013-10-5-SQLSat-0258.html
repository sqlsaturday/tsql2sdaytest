<h3>“SQL Attack…ed” – SQL Server under attack.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Although SQL Server is considered "secure by default", one of the most often successfully attacked targets is the data that resides in a SQL Server. Most of the exploited weaknesses are due to misconfiguration or weak coding practices. In this purely demo-based security session, I will show several real life attack scenarios on different layers. Due to special request this includes some special SQL Injection types. Furthermore I show how an elevation of privileges attack is possible due to a not uncommon configuration as well as an “insider-exploit” with a database root kit.
 – Note: there will be no instructions on how to attack a system, but rather highlight common weaknesses. – (almost) no slides: Demos Demos Demos

<h3>Leveraging Hadoop Cluster from SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the explosion of data, the open source Apache™ Hadoop™ Framework is gaining traction thanks to its huge ecosystem that has arisen around the core functionalities of Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS™) and Hadoop Map Reduce. As of today, being able to have SQL Server working with Hadoop™ becomes increasingly important because the two are indeed complementary. For instance, while petabytes of data can be stored unstructured in Hadoop and take hours to be queried, terabytes of data can be stored in a structured way in the SQL Server platform and queried in seconds. This leads to the need to transfer data between Hadoop and SQL Server.

In this session, We will explore how SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), i.e. the SQL Server Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) tool, can be used to automate Hadoop + non Hadoop job executions, and manage data transfers between Hadoop and other sources and destinations</p>

<h3>SQL Performance and Monitoring in Windows Azure at Scale</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Level: 300
Abstract:
This session focuses on lessons learnt from performance tuning one of the largest Windows Azure SQL Database deployments in the world. We will work through approach and methodology worked through specifically in Non-Functional Testing and monitoring phase. The session will look at design decisions and match them to real examples. We will spend time on how the monitoring requirements were defined, then how the design was turned into a reality.

<h3>Clustered Columnstore - Introduction</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2014 receives a very new  important feature - Clustered Columnstore Indexes.  Using a xVelocity compression and a batch processing mode this type of indexes which was introduced in SQL Server 2012 is greatly enhanced by making it a Clustered and making it a default recommend solution for the DataWarehouse solutions. Join to discover the Clustered Columnstore Indexes by understanding on which principles they are built and what should you do get the best out of them.
This new feature is targeted at the OLAP installations and it is already available for the PDW (Parallel DataWarehouse) v2. </p>

<h3>The Internals of SQL Server Wait Types</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session the internals of wait types will be discovered.
SQL Server database engine uses wait types for internal operations. 
What is the importance of  the wait type? 
How does it help us to troubleshoot the performance?
What are the wait types that are very common?
What are the wait types that you can safely ignore?
How can we use Extended Events to debug wait types

I will assume the audience has a basic working knowledge of SQL Server including an understanding of some of the more common SQL Server engine DMVs such as sys.dm_exec_sessions, sys.dm_exec_requests and sys.dm_os_wait_stats</p>
