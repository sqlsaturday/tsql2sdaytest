<h3>Revolutionary R integration in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The R integration brings a lot of benefits and new scenarios to on premises data platform systems:
•	R can greatly simplify collection of different data.
•	Data manipulation and preparation can also be way easier with R.
•	You can use R to quickly explore and visualize data. 
•	Last but not least, R brings the whole power of modern data mining techniques to SQL Server.   
As if this was not enough, you can use familiar user interface and SQL Server Enterprise R Services to work with large datasets and multi-threaded, multi-core, multi-process computations. So, even if you don’t know R at all, come and see how natural this language is for everybody who already think in rows and columns.

<h3>To NHibernate or not to NHibernate</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every developer heard at least once about NHibernate. There are lots of articles and performance tests describing how fast it runs and how easy is to integrate NHibernate into your application.

In this session I will try to explain why would one consider NHibernate as an option for his application stack, how to solve typical DBA complaints and give a brief comparison of how fast is NHibernate versus ADO.NET with stored procedures.

This session will be interesting to application developers who never worked with NHibernate but want to start, as well as for DBAs to gather some knowledge about how an application works including database layer.
I will also provide some demos to show why NHibernate is not as good as developers might think, and why it is better than DBAs think about this tool.</p>

<h3>Fun with Legal Information in SQL Server: Data Retrieval</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Learn about typical challenges in legal information retrieval, the techniques used in querying data by determining its legal relevance, and how SQL Server 2016 can be used to simplify some of these techniques. For instance, a very important element of legal proceedings is determining which law should be used. Legal rules change over time, resulting in multiple versions of the same law. Laws do not last forever, and can be replaced by other laws (one old law can be replaced by one or more new laws). The timeline of events that are relevant to a particular court case provide one set of criteria to be used to determine the correct law and the correct version of the law. Another example is the trade of products and/or services. In order for a contract to be valid there must be a clear correlation between the offer to buy (or to sell) a product or a service and the corresponding counter-offer. They must both be valid simultaneously, they must both specify the same products or services, and </p>

<h3>Easy ETL with Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Can ETL be fun? Unfortunately very often creation of ETL layer is a time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone task. What’s more, any change in requirements needs a lot of work to be redone. In our session we’ll present new approach to creating BI solutions using Biml language and BimlStudio programming environment. They greatly simplify the process, allowing for amazing flexibility, and make the ETL work more pleasant. We will show real examples of how Biml and C# generates hundreds of usable SSIS packages in just couple of minutes. We will also cover integration of ETL with TFS and CI for ETL. Everything with 100% compatibility with unmodified SQL Server. Join us and see how BI just became fun again.</p>

<h3>Azure Machine Learning: From Design to Integration</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science concerned with systems that learn from data. So this isn’t about systems that follow explicitly programmed instructions, but rather about systems that find patterns and trends within datasets, and use them to deliver insight and predictions.

In this session, you will learn how an Azure Machine Learning solution comes to life: From the creation of a workspace, to the preparation of data, to experimentation with Machine Learning algorithms, and then finally to the integration and embedding of predictive insights into applications.

This session has been specifically designed to describe Machine Learning fundamentals, and to help enable and inspire existing data professionals taking their first steps to leverage cloud-based predictive models delivered with Azure Machine Learning. It is guaranteed to thrill you with potential, and excite you with the relative ease by which it can be accomplished.</p>

<h3>Power BI Desktop – Leveraging the magic of Power BI - ON-PREM</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It won’t be long before we host the majority of our data, compute power, reporting, and BI visualizations in the cloud, but we’re not all there quite yet. In this presentation, we will discuss ONLY those options that are available on-premises, covering functionality differences between Power BI and Power BI Desktop as well as the critical integration of .pbix dashboards and visualizations with other enterprise reporting and collaboration tools, such as SharePoint, PowerPoint, Excel, and SQL Server Reporting Services. We’ll also highlight the Microsoft BI roadmap for SQL Server 2016, SSRS Paginated and Mobile Reports, Power BI, and what it means specifically for on-premise customers.</p>

<p>Utilising the off-line sales data of retail chain to significantly increase their on-line sales. Show casing different levels of  sophistication for product suggestions, from easy collaborative filtering to advanced models. Explaining what it takes SQL-wise to build each stage of the progress of suggestion engine.</p>

<h3>Power BI – “5 Minutes to WOW”, but HOW?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft Corporate VP James Phillips summarizes Power BI with the simple phrase “5 minutes to WOW!”, but how do we make this a reality? In this talk, we’ll use Power BI to connect multiple data sources to unlock the mysteries of the data to allow application owners and senior leadership to better understand and make key decisions with their data. We'll talk about the "how" you need to create compelling data presentations even if you don't have a data warehouse or SSAS environment: dashboards from SharePoint lists, Excel, web sites or SQL Server databases will also get you that "wow". Attend the talk today and create your first amazing dashboard tomorrow!</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2016 Security Enhancements</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we'll explore new security features of SQL Server 2016. There's a big list of new features making SQL Server even more secure and flexible. We'll talk about row level security, dynamic data masking, always encrypted and others. All these new features will be explained with practical examples on their usage for production deployments.</p>

<h3>What Application Developers Should Know About SQL Server?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Nowadays many companies don't have dedicated developer positions. Therefore the most of the SQL code has been written by application developers. And they use only a subset of SQL Server features and usually in a suboptimal manner.
I spent last ten years working with application developers and have collected common mistakes and misunderstandings between them and DBAs that increase development, test and deployment costs and reduce the overall quality.
In this session we will cover the most important things they need to know about SQL Server and that cannot be easily or cheap fixed by DBAs or consultants.</p>

<h3>Top 10 SSAS Solution Design Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Proper design of cubes, dimensions, hierarchies and attributes is critical to optimal performance of SQL Server Analysis Services solutions.

I've collected a number of best practices during the years I've spent on building and maintaining OLAP cubes. In this session, we will go through the most important ten of these, so you can consider them in your everyday work when you build analytical back-end solutions with SSAS. Join this session, and see how these tips and best practices can save your precious time.</p>
