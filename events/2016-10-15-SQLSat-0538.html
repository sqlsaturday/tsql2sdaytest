<h3>Tired of connecting on-prem  cloud data? Take a DB stretch</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You can stretch your legs and relax and get a quick session on delivering your analytics against hot, warm  cold data. If you are not aware of the concept behind hot, warm and cold data, it simply speaks about the age of the data that resides in your systems. 

Stretch Database is the new concept, which allows you to stretch your data from on-premises to cloud without a need of any SSIS packages or any other automation. In this session you will understand, enabling / disabling data stretch, reading data from stretched database, setup remote data archiving and backup  restore for the stretch enabled databases. Stretch DB also covers the concepts of Shallow  Deep backups.</p>

<h3>Are You a DBA by Accident? Welcome to the Club!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When I joined runtastic.com to build their very first centralized data warehouse with Microsoft SQL Server, no one really felt in charge of the server – so the responsibility fell into my humble hands. Besides my duties as a business intelligence architect (designing  implementing the database, ETL  cube), I had to quickly come up with a solution for the most important administrative tasks:
•	Disaster Recovery and Failover
•	Database Maintenance
•	Capacity Management
•	Job  Performance Monitoring
In this session I will invite you to discuss the pros  cons of the solutions I came up with and you will leave the session with helpful concepts and scripts which you can use freely.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Performance Tuning. Old-School Practical Guide.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Nothing is perfect, which means that your database may be not perfect as well. And one day you may decide that your database is slow and it's time to optimize it. But.. Where to start? When to end? What to look at? Which queries are slow? How to identify the real bottleneck? And so on, and so on. There are a lot of questions that should be answered in a process of performance tuning. 

In this session, we will find answers to all these questions going from collecting data for analysis, through identifying bottlenecks to optimization of the particular queries. On this way, we will learn performance tuning practical techniques and solve a bunch of issues in real-time. All this will be done using plain old tools, which are available on your system by default: Profiler, Performance Monitor, SSMS, and DMVs. Minimum of theory and a lot of practice.</p>

<h3>Building an SQL Server 2016 AlwaysON Availability Solution (Part 1)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 has major enhancements to existing features as well as brand new ones that will contribute to making SQL Server implementations more highly available. 
This two-part session will cover not only what is in SQL Server 2016, such as all of the improvements to availability groups like seeding and basic AGs, but important Windows Server 2016 features like site awareness, storage replica, and more that all DBAs should be aware of. With this extended session, most of what will be discussed will be shown so you can see how they work. The session is based on practical scenarios from a customer’s implementation. We will start with requirements list and will end up with an implemented solution.</p>

<h3>Identity Mapping and De-Duplicating </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In an enterprise, merging master data, like customer data, from multiple sources is a common problem. Typically, you do not have a single, i.e. the same key identifying a customer in different sources. You have to match data based on similarity of strings, like names and addresses. In this session, we are going to check how different algorithms for comparing strings included in SQL Server  work. We are going to use four different algorithms that come with Master Data Services (Levenshtein, Jaccard, Jaro-Winkler and Ratcliff-Obershelp), and Fuzzy Lookup transformation from Integration Services. Finally, we are going to introduce how SQL Server Data Quality Services help us here.</p>

<h3>Mobile BI with Microsoft tools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In SQL Server 2016 (currently availabe as a preview) Microsoft added support for mobile reports to Reporting Services.
They also released the Mobile Report Publisher for authoring and creation of mobile reports. This application is based on Datazen technology, a company that Microsoft acquired in 2015.
As Microsoft stated, using only one mobile BI app users will access dashboards and reports on mobile devices.

Now developers must choose a tool  for developing BI optimized for mobile devices: SSRS,  Mobile Report Publisher (former Datazen) or Power BI? The question is: which one to choose? What are the key factor for supporting the correct decision? 
We will provide a clear and understandable overview of each product, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
Based on some real examples we will set out a comparison matrix to find the best way to meet your needs with the right mobile reporting tool. </p>

<h3>Data Science on Premise with Microsoft SQL Server 2016 and R-Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is coming to SQL Server. SQL Server 2016 includes new real-time analytics, automatic data encryption, and the ability to run R within the database itself. For deeper insights into data, SQL Server 2016 expands its scope beyond transaction processing, data warehousing and business intelligence to deliver advanced analytics as an additional workload in SQL Server with proven technology from Revolution Analytics.  Microsoft SQL Server team want to make advanced analytics more accessible and also to increase performance for your advanced analytic workloads by bringing R processing closer to the data and building advanced analytic capabilities right into SQL Server. With this update, data scientists will no longer need to extract data from SQL server via ODBC to analyze it with R. Instead, you will be able to take your R code to the data, where is will be run inside a sandbox process within SQL Server itself. This eliminates the time and storage required to move the data, and gives you al</p>

<h3>Introduction to SQL Server Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you still prefer troubleshooting issues using SQL Server Profiler, because you find Extended Events too complicated? Or is it because you have never used Extended Events before, or it was in the dark ages of 2008 and your love for XML wasn’t strong enough to make you use them? The good news are that the recent versions of SQL Server give you a nice UI and made it all as user friendly as possible. The bad news are that you have no excuse anymore to not use them! Join this session to learn the basics of SQL Server Extended Events. You will see example use cases that could make your life easier and will learn how to troubleshoot issues in a modern and efficient way.</p>

<h3>Crafting killer real time apps with SignalR and SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This talk will introduce you to the world of real time apps.
Nowadays with the help of advanced SDKs like SignalR, real time apps are almost trivial to create and are the ones that provide the "Wow!" factor to our clients.
Having real time capabilities in your application is important, can solve you big problems and users gradually start taking them for a given.
You will learn how to create an app that magically updates its data and of course some nice tricks about SignalR and SQL Server.
Cool demos are guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Big Data analytics with Microsoft R Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is the world's most widely-used programming language for data analysis. Despite being the most popular, R suffers from lack of scalability and being slow. 
In this demo heavy session I will introduce you to the fundamentals of Microsoft R Server, it’s native file format XDF (eXternal Data Frame), data analytics and manipulation  functions, as well to scalable machine learning algorithms. 
Don’t miss the opportunity to see how MRS addresses open source R scalability and performance issues.</p>

<h3>Native JSON support in SQL 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Alongside with all other features SQL 2016 now natively supports JSON – one of the most common formats for data exchange. SQL 2016 now has built-in capabilities to query, analyze, exchange and transform JSON data. 
JSON functionality is quite similar to SQL XML support  but despite this being one of the most desired additions to SQL 2016 there is a flavour of something missing – the JSON data type. 
In this session we will talk about JSON support features, limitations and some tricks to overcome these.

<p>Currently a Lead Software Engineer at EPAM Systems, with a decade of experience in the most obscure places of CS.

Officially a CSharp.NET developer,
