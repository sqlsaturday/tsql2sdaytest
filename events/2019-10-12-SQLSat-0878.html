<h3>Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ll find a lot of Word of Mouth (WOM) advice out there about SQL Server performance, especially
when it comes to indexes. Some of the things you have probably heard are:
 keep clustered index width small
 unique indexes perform better
 keep non-clustered index width small
 compressed indexes have fewer logical reads
 add one index for each column

But how do you know if this advice is good or bad? Did you know that there is a way to look under the hood at the actual index pages to see how the data is stored, and how it’s stored differently when data is compressed? Using this information, you can prove or disprove the WOM advice.
Attend this demo-heavy session to learn how the SQL Server optimizer uses indexes. It’s all about
performance, and the right indexes will give your application a big performance advantage.</p>

<h3>Driven by the 9s - I need a highly available Microsoft Data Platform – what features should I use?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft’s data platform and SQL Server comes with a plethora of High Availability features. Some of these features can work hand-in glove with each other to allow you to configure your SQL Servers to be both Highly-Available and recoverable in the event of the worst happening. 

If you are driven by the '9s', have strict SLAs and up time is key to you and your business, then combining SQL Server’s high availability features is something you should consider. 

In this session we will look at how we can combine SQL Server Availability Groups and SQL Server Failover cluster instances to keep our servers both highly available and maintain a secondary disaster recovery.</p>

<h3>The Maths Behind Machine Learning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The new world of Machine Learning can sound quite overwhelming! Do I need a PhD in Machine Learning to get involved? The answer, thankfully, is no. But what you do need, which is often neglected, is a solid understanding of the theory behind the models. 

This session will look to do just that, looking at some of the most popular algorithms used today, we will explore the maths involved, to help us understand our problems and get the best results possible. We will be also diving into practical examples, using Databricks to consume a dataset and to visualise results, with R  Python scripts to execute the Machine Learning models. 

If you would like an introduction to the world of Machine Learning and to acquire a solid grounding that will help you develop the skill, then this is the session for you.</p>

<h3>ML in PowerBI for Business and Pros</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Machine Learning is approaching a peak of inflated expectations, although we see AI daily and in all contexts. Media pressure is high, governments are overly optimistic, plenty of ventures are putting money in nonviable ideas or some brilliant engineers fail to reach business users. ​

But Microsoft bring all of this under the same roof and unleash the power of AI by integrating Power BI ecosystem with Azure ML and Cognitive services. The result is as simple and effective as great technology at end-user's hand.​
This session is not about learning how to do AI but how to make AI usable and add value. Integrating ML models and sophisticated cognitive services in reports, understanding concealed relations and bringing automated ML empowers any business user to exploit AI for better decisions, regardless of his technical skills.</p>

<h3>Microsoft PowerApps: Creating apps with less time  effort</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will show how to use PowerApps to build YOUR next customized business application! As part of Microsoft’s Power Platform, this cloud-based suite can allow the design and development of your application in minutes – without requiring extensive coding background and with no need to worry about where to host the application! Apart from easy integration with other Microsoft technologies, it also allows integrations with third-party services with minor setup required, through out-of-the-box connectors!

During this session we will go through some examples of how an application can be built from scratch, using connections to other data-sources and highlighting some important tips to keep in mind during development – learnt through our real-life projects! 

It might also be worth keeping in mind one thing: PowerApps could also be part of your modern data warehouse architecture! So, if you’re thinking “applications are not for me”, then think twice!</p>

<h3>Successful Enterprise Roll-out of Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many enterprise organisations bought into the self-service gold rush and rolled Power BI out to their users and let them loose. They now find themselves with a mass of uncontrolled workspaces, hundreds of duplicated reports and the kind of conflicting KPI definitions that started the whole warehousing movement in the first place.

A self service environment for most organisations, is a big cultural and business shift,
this session looks to address how Power BI should be deployed and managed in an Enterprise scenario, along with how to manage business change and what we can do with Power BI to ensure a smooth transition into a the new world of self-service reporting.</p>

<h3>Hidden gems of SQL Server 2017</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2017 is full of new features and improvements. The main "Killer" feature of SQL Server 2017 is SQL Server on Linux, but there are some more big and interesting features: Adaptive Query Processing, Graph Processing, Automatic Tuning and many others which you are aware of. And in this session we will not talk  about them. We will not do that just because there are a lot of cool features in SQL Server 2017, which are more hidden from our sight and have not get enough attention. 

In this session, we will learn a lot about these features and improvements. Which features? This is a secret :) Come to the session and discover them with me!</p>

<h3>A star is born - a.k.a. Power BI data modeling</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI is broadly marketed as a self-service BI tool which could be easily mastered even by a non-technical user. Often the focus of the development is not on the data model but on the reports and the respective measures needed for the analytical solution. However, if the data model, even a simple one, does not follow some fundamental design rules, the potential analyses are seriously hampered. In this session we will see the most important design concepts for a good BI data model.</p>
