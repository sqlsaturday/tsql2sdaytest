<h3>SQL Injections and How to Stop Them</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Right now, there are hackers all around the world trying to get into your web applications. How safe are you? By using a technique called SQL injections, hackers can wreak havoc with web applications by compromising security, manipulating data, hoarding system resources, retrieving sensitive information, and manipulate data database objects such as dropping databases! 

During the demo, we will take on a couple of different roles. As a hacker we will walk through steps a hacker might take to compromise a web application in order to retrieve sensitive data such as credit card information, usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. Assuming the role of a developer, we will then show various prevention techniques and their effectiveness in preventing SQL injections.

Attend this session to learn how SQL injections work, identify if you are being attacked, and how to stop them.</p>

<h3>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures, filled with table variables, instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cut that work from hours or days to minutes or even seconds. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. Learn:
• The most useful regular expression commands
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods</p>

<h3>Data Modeling for Integration of RDBMS with NOSQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Join us to explore how emerging data modeling methods and model notations help us define, and easily communicate, robust integration points between NOSQL data stores and emerging RDBMS 'Lean Data Warehouse' models that would otherwise be challenging to map across due to radical differences in normalization.   Did you buy the pitch about how 'BigData and RDBMS  Data Warehouses can remain in isolation'.      Me neither!      You will leave this sessions not only free from some rigid E/R modeling assumptions and diagramming standards, but also armed with an introduction to a practical method of logical data modeling in the new world of polyglot data storage.</p>

<h3>Mastering and Enhancing Company Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.</p>

<h3>PolyBase in SQL Server 2016: Query Hadoop with ease</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the increased volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data , organizations are adopting heterogeneous data stores like Hadoop and cloud, requiring new skill sets to operate and making it harder for DBAs to build applications over them. This session will describe PolyBase, a new feature in SQL Server 2016, that will open the doors to data stored outside of SQL Server. PolyBase allows customers to use T-SQL to access and query data residing in Hadoop or Azure blob storage. It can intelligently push-down computation to Hadoop by generating Map jobs on-the-fly as well as scale-out query processing in SQL Server to enable highly performant queries on massive Hadoop data sets. 

This session will cover the PolyBase fundamentals of what the feature is, how customers are using it and how it works under-the-covers. In addition, the session will include a Live Demonstration of how PolyBase can be used to bring relational and semi-structured data together using SQL skill sets.</p>

<h3>VLDB: Partitioning in SQL Server Standard Edition.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Partitioning has long been one of the key feature sets utilized to improve performance or reduce contention within our large tables in SQL Server. However, table partitioning has been solely the prerogative of SQL Server Enterprise edition. You may be asking yourself, “Why is he talking about table partitioning?  Didn’t we just establish it’s only available in Enterprise and not available to us Standard edition users?”   Even though you’d be correct, there are techniques available to us in Standard edition which would accomplish the same result as table partitioning. Yes, I am talking about partitioned views.

In this session we will go through the steps needed to configure and use the partitioned views to achieve the same result as table partitioning. We will also configure the maintenance jobs to demonstrate the sliding window functionality, and for those of us who are lucky to have Enterprise edition, we will see how to be able to take advantage of combining the use of both partitio</p>

<h3>Mysteries of Data Masking Revealed -  in Azure, SQL Server, and beyond.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Masking, or Data De-identification, is a technique allowing a database practitioner to hide data with "false" values. Done in  response to the compliance regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA, PCI and other, it allows securing data in variable ways based on the user role in the organization. Data Masking is not encryption! The strategies and algorithms would differ whether you need to use it in production or non-production environment and whether you need to apply it enterprise -wide or in separate applications. Learn about data masking as a part of privacy - by -design strategy and how to decide what to use and where.</p>

<h3>Keeping your SQL Objects Safe In Development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It has been a long established practice to keep maintain application code in version control. Versioning your application code allows you to view changes made by several developers working on the same project. It allows the team to get the latest changes in a consistent and reliable manner. It allows you to return your code to a prior state. It even acts as a safety net for when that day comes when your developer’s computer won’t turn on.

So, what about your SQL Objects? 

Join me in this demo heavy session where we will explore the benefits of versioning your SQL Objects and learn how it can enable streamlined database development without sacrificing control and visibility. We’ll be using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control tool for demos, and we’ll see how it integrates with your existing version control software to manage your SQL Objects just like application code.</p>

<h3>The Key to Keys</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So many of us have learned  database design approaches from working with one database or data technology. We may have used only one data modeling or development tool.  That means our vocabularies around identifiers and keys tend to be product specific.  Do you know the difference between a unique index and a unique key? What about the difference between RI, FK and AK?

These concepts span data activities and it's important that your team understand each other and where they, their tools and approaches need to support these features.

We'll look at the generic and proprietary terms for these concepts, as well as where they fit in the database design process.  We'll also look at implementation options in SQL Server and other DBMSs.

<h3>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.</p>

She has not only been a database developer, but also an application developer, even before Visual Studio existed. She is now thankful to be focusing on database design, t-SQL development, and query optimization. She also has a habit of enjoying SSIS and data warehouse design.

She blogs regularly on her website mickeystuewe.com and contributes to sites such as SQL Server Central and SQL Server Pro. She enjoys presenting at PASS Summit, SQL Saturdays, User Groups and other events.

When she is not immersed in SQL related activities, she enjoys action movies, art, reading, and laughing. She laughs loudly and often...just ask her children.</p>
