<h3>Creating Dynamic Packages</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In a perfect world an ETL solution would only have to import data from a single file that always had the same name deliver it to a single already existing table.  Unfortunately this case is the exception rather than the rule.  How can you use SSIS to: 
1.    Iterate through all files in a folder and import their content into SQL
2.    Dynamically create and name table based on a data source 
3.    Dynamically create a T-SQL statement at runtime based on run time conditions
This session focuses on how to create SSIS packages that can change to meet runtime events dynamically based on the environment.
Each attendee will leave with the knowledge and toolset necessary to:
1.      Use expressions within SSIS packages
2.      Use variables to dynamically create SQL statements
3.      Configure custom dynamic logging
4.      Use package configurations and parameters and environments to make packages more portable at execution
5. 	Replace dynamic SQL using expressions in SSIS</p>

<h3>Mobile, Paginated, KPIs, and Power BI, Oh My! SSRS 2016 Reporting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2016 is getting the biggest update since SQL Server 2005! This session will define and demo each of the SSRS report types are and how they are developed and supported: Mobile (previously DataZen reports), Paginated (SSRS RDL reports), KPIs (new standalone Key Performance Indicators), and Power BI (now Power BI can be managed in SSRS for an on-premises solution). All of these report types can now be managed in SSRS for a single reporting solution.

We will also look at the new SSRS Web Portal (replacement for Report Manager) and how the development environment will change as well. Sometime will also be spent on how to support all of these report types and the impact it will have on IT.
If you have been curious about what has changed with SSRS in SQL Server 2016 and you want to be ahead of the curve, this is the session for you!</p>

<h3>To Compress or Decompress—that is this Session</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Compression has been available since SQL Server 2008 in the Enterprise Editions, but it’s now available across all editions starting in 2016 Service Pack 1 and worth checking out if you haven’t able to in the past. You know that data compression can help save on storage space, but do you know when it doesn’t? You’ve heard that it can cost additional CPU to use it, but is that always the case, and how much CPU overhead is there really?  Do you know how it can improve I/O performance and enhance SQL Server memory usage?  In this session I’ll take you through a real-world example and case study to illustrate the benefits and drawbacks of SQL Server Data Compression to not only show you how it works, but more importantly, when it works, and how to determine whether data will compress well, and perform well.  You’ll leave this session with the information and checklists needed to figure out how to use data compression in your database.</p>

<h3>Performance in 60 Seconds – SQL Tricks Everybody MUST Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data and Database is a very important aspect of application development for businesses. Developers often come across situations where they face a slow server response, even though their hardware specifications are above par. This session is for all the Developers who want their server to perform at blazing fast speed, but want to invest very little time to make it happen. We will go over various database tricks which require absolutely no time to master and require practically no SQL coding at all. After attending this session, Developers will only need 60 seconds to improve performance of their database server in their implementation. We will have a quiz during the session to keep the conversation alive. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session</p>

<h3>Reports on the Go: SSRS 2016 Mobile Reporting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services added  reporting functionality with a new report type of Mobile. Mobile reports is the new name for the DataZen reports that was a separate reporting solution before Microsoft acquired DataZen a few years ago. Now with SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services the Mobile report type has been integrated into the platform and can be delivered using the SSRS data sources and datasets you have already developed for Paginated reports. In this session we will walkthrough how to create/update Mobile reports using the SSRS 2016 Mobile Report Publisher application and how the Mobile reports are delivered through the new SSRS Web Portal and apps for iOS/Android/Windows. We will also cover the pluses and minuses of developing new Mobile reports with Power BI also working on mobile platforms. There will be plenty of demos and time for questions in this session.</p>

<h3>Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.</p>

<h3>Optimizing Query Plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Queries that take 45 minutes aren’t fun for anyone. However, many people don’t know where to start in order to speed things up, and far too often it becomes a regular occurrence in IT departments. In “Optimizing T-SQL Queries”, you will learn the basics of optimizing query plans. You will learn how to examine and understand query execution plans, diagnose missing indexes, and understand the various types of joins available to you in order to get your queries running quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Tracking Data Changes with Temporal Tables and more</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The need to keep track of the ‘what’ and ‘when' associated with data changes is a common requirement for data driven applications.  However, the business requirements for ‘why’ and ‘how’ those data changes are tracked can be very application specific.  Fortunately, SQL Server has a few different tools to help us out.  In this presentation we’ll look at 
- Temporal Tables
