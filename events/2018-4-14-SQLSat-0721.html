<h3>Laying the Foundations for GDPR Compliance.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>GDPR is coming, no matter where you are if you are handling data on European data subjects. Laying a solid foundation of data security practices is vital to avoid the potential fines and damage to reputation that being non-compliant can bring.

Practicing good data hygiene is vital to meeting compliance requirements, whether it is GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA or other standards. The fundamentals around data identification, classification, and management are universal. Together we will look at some of the key areas that you can address to speed up your readiness for meeting GDPR requirements. Including what data is covered, principals for gaining consent, data access requests as well as other key recommended practices.

By the end of this session you will be able to start the groundwork on getting your organization in shape for its journey to compliance.If you want to avoid the big fines, up to EUR 20 million or 4% of global turnover whichever is higher, it is important to act early.</p>

<h3>Screw DevOps, Let's Talk DataOps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is the new hot topic for IT, but only answers part of the problem. This session and demo will discuss why data creates continual friction in the DevOps environment and how it must be incorporated into the solution.
Reasons for this solution is required: -Data is getting bigger and more complex -Security concerns around critical data is becoming more evident every day -Data is created in silos in many sources, yet consumed in just as many locations, including on-premises and in the cloud.

We'll discuss the tech, the politics and the challenges of bringing data into DevOps and how to do so more successfully with culture changes, tools, scripting, and virtualization.

Takeaways from this session:
1. Learn the five principles of Data Ops 2. How embracing a dynamic data platform can eliminate challenges and provide automation. 3. Learn the difference between containers, packages and data pods. 4. Learn how to bridge the gap between data and people, eliminating culture from the scene</p>

<h3>SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.</p>

<h3>Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.</p>

<h3>Controlling Competing Workloads with SQL Server Resource Governor</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With heavily consolidated instances and competing workloads, the Enterprise only Resource Governor feature is an incredibly useful tool for any DBA to have in their toolbox. It allows for the effective throttling and control of CPU, memory and I/O consumed by multiple workloads running on a single SQL Server instance. In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the SQL Server Resource Governor and provide demonstrations of practical scenarios where Resource Governor can control resources for specific workloads. Some of these demonstrations include how to limit the amount of memory consumed by memory-optimized tables and how to prevent poorly-written queries from overwhelming your storage subsystem. We will also discuss cases where Resource Governor can mitigate parameter sniffing problems. Finally, we will look at ways to leverage the useful information contained in the Resource Governor DMVs for monitoring and reporting.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Then and Now: Changing the State of Long-held Beliefs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We’ve all heard the rules for SQL Server like separate your data from your log, watch for a disk queue length over 2, and a low Page Life Expectancy always means memory pressure.  All of these used to be true, but on today’s hardware and SQL Server versions – they are dangerously outdated.  In this session, we will take on a bunch of these old “givens” of SQL Server that everybody has heard and followed, the underlying technological reasons they were true then, how today’s technology has rendered them obsolete, and what the new rules are that you need to know.  So whether you are one of the old guard looking to refresh your set of working SQL Server rules or a member of the up-and-comers looking for the facts to win over the old guard, this session is for you.</p>

<h3>Getting the Skinny on Minimally Logged Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Any changes to Non-Memory Optimized tables require a certain amount of logging to the transaction log in order to ensure the integrity of the operation and of course the data. Most of these are fully logged operations and can write a tremendous amount of data to the transaction log. As you probably already know this can lead to various performance and availability issues. However you may be able to minimize the effect of these with what is called a minimally logged operation. This session will outline how these can be used under the right conditions to save time, resources and potentially a lot of headaches. Various demos will hit home on just how much of an impact this can have on some every day operations.</p>

<h3>A Beginner's Guide To Plan Guides</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Even with the increased simplicity of plan forcing using Query Data Store in SQL Server 2016 and above, plan guides remain a very powerful but often overlooked feature of SQL server. There is a misconception in the community that plan guides are really only useful for situations where the DBA "cannot change the code" but actually plan guides have much broader applicability than simply fixing problems with poorly designed ISV code. However, for the DBA, working with plan guides can often be a confusing and frustrating experience. 

In this session we will cover what plan guides are, how they work and demonstrate scenarios where they can be successfully used to solve a number of problems DBAs experience on a day to day basis.</p>

<h3>I/O Tuning 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.</p>

<h3>SQL Server and Docker</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Containers are everywhere.  If server virtualization dominated the past decade, then this decade belongs to the containers.  Name any product, and there is a container image of that product ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.  Containers can be used for hosting any type of application, and in this session, we'll take a look at what you need to know to get started with containers with respect to SQL Server, and address some of the common questions that come up during this setup.</p>

<h3>Lost in Translation:  ༂རཱི⿻�〄ポשׁ�ꬤﾫ◬Ꮡ�☠o̐̈́̈́̈́͢ㅴ</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>String data is far more complex than most people are aware of. The US English alphabet and punctuation (i.e. standard ASCII) are relatively simple, but they make up a very small portion of the alphabets and non-language symbols that can be represented. Given the increasing need to handle multiple languages, it is important to understand collations and encodings before getting collation mismatch errors or losing data.

In this presentation we will cover: the actual differences between VARCHAR and NVARCHAR, what Collations are and can do, binary collations (and why they aren't truly case sensitive), SQL Server vs Windows collations, supplementary characters and surrogate pairs, Collation Precedence, Code Pages, ASCII / Unicode / UTF-8 / UTF-16 / UCS-2 encodings, combining characters, what server-level and database-level default collations do, ramifications of changing a database's collation, multi-byte character sets, NVARCHAR to VARCHAR "best fit" mappings, and other fascinating topics.</p>

<h3>Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!</p>

<h3>Writing Advanced Functions in PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A lot of DBAs use Powershell to help automate complex tasks or apply configuration changes to multiple servers. Many are writing their own functions, and some may even have packaged them up into a custom module. What about more advanced features? How many are using verbose output, pipeline parameters, or parameter validation? These are just some of the features of something called "Advanced Functions" in PowerShell. In this session, we will discuss these topics and more as we work through all the components of a sample Advanced PowerShell function.

This session will be geared towards DBAs but will be useful for anyone wanting to learn more about PowerShell. Experience writing basic PowerShell functions is not a requirement, but will definitely make it easier to follow along. I highly recommend bringing a laptop with PowerShell 5.1 installed so attendees can follow along.</p>

<h3>Building the HASSP: Putting SQL Server In Space</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In today's world, technology is a pervasive part of our lives. We have "smart" appliances everywhere: from cars, thermostats, and even refrigerators contain built-in systems to collect, store, and transmit data. Small embedded devices can also be used for scientific purposes as well, offering new and exciting ways to collect data for studies or projects at home.

The High-Altitude SQL Server Project, or HASSP, is one such project.

The HASSP team has created a high-altitude balloon that uses sensors to collect various data points and store the results in an embedded version of SQL Server!

In this session, you'll hear about how this is possible: we'll discuss the hardware used, the custom device that we built, and the software used to make it all work together. Best of all, you'll see how to recreate (and hopefully improve!) the project on your own.</p>

<h3>REST Easy - Instant APIs for Your Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server provides database technology built with industry-leading performance, top-notch security and compliance, mission-critical availability, and a consistent experience across platforms and devices.
API-driven data consumption platforms and services highlight the need for RESTful access to SQL server data. The existing options for REST access to SQL Server data or using web development frameworks to convert relational data to JSON objects soak up time, resources, and energy on software development and maintenance that enterprises could be using to drive business.
With the CData API Server, users can rapidly create RESTful APIs for SQL Server data using a point-and-click interface. API Server includes everything needed to create, run, manage, and secure APIs for your SQL Server data. In this talk, we will walk through creating an OData API for SQL Server data and demonstrate connectivity using modern web development frameworks</p>

<h3>Build Your Extract Packages Automatically!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Automating extract packages is trivial., you simply use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.  The problem is not all your data sources have easy to read metadata like SQL Server.  How do you create usable metadata from these sources? In this hour, I’ll show you how easy it is to make an educated guess on the schema of flat files and other “semi-structured” data sources.  

With that schema, automatically generating your extract package is a matter of seconds!  Join me while I share my interrogator project with you and start saving hours at work today!</p>

<h3>The Amazing Utility of ROW_NUMBER()</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When it was introduced way back in SQL Server 2005, the lowly ROW_NUMBER() function at first seemed to have little functionality other than simply counting rows.  However, over time we have come to see this humble function is actually surprisingly useful in often unexpected ways.  In this session we will discover the creative uses of ROW_NUMBER() in ways that you may likely not have yet considered.  This session will be filled with little goodies that can you can use, whether you are a writing SQL for application code or for administrative functionality.</p>

<h3>Alexa – Skills Development, Data, and Continuous Improvement</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>"Alexa, make Song Quiz smarter and more fun." That command may not work (yet), but this session can give you the tools and knowledge to enhance Alexa's ability to do all kinds of fun and useful things. Alexa is fast growing to be the strongest of the three personal assistants.  Much of this growth has come from the fact that Amazon opened up 3rd party development through their Skills program. In this session, we’ll start with the Alexa ecosystem and terminology. We’ll then cover the infrastructure behind skills and development framework We’ll wrap things up with how to implement continuous improvement, by using data to drive it all!</p>

<h3>Monitoring with sp_WhoIsActive, PowerShell and PowerBI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Everyone knows sp_WhoIsActive by Adam Machanic! In this session, we will see how its output captured periodically to a central database using PowerShell can be used as an effective monitoring tool with the analytics provided by Power BI. sp_WhoIsActive puts out the best output. PowerShell is the best at collecting data centrally from multiple servers and Power BI is the best at presenting and analyzing the results. The session will bring together features of sp_WhoIsActive, PowerShell and PowerBI to get an effective solution.</p>
