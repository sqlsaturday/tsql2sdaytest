<h3>T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users or adequate volume of data  is exists there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live and they become performing badly ending up with standstill cases sometimes , this is due to lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs so I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be analyzed within this session)</p>

<h3>Data Quality Services (Deep dive)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Quality Services (DQS) is one of the main mechanisms for data normalization, removing duplicate content and filling knowledge base. It allows you to perform various operations to obtain quality data. The main feature is the creation of the knowledge base, in which there are basic configuration, data manipulation rules. DQS Cleansing is the standard SSIS control, which is used for normalization (cleansing) data.

In this session two new controls will be introduced: DQS Domain Value Import and DQS Matching Transformation. During the session SSIS package will be created. This package will automate the process of importing domain entities, including synonyms, to the existing knowledge base. Also mechanism for removing duplicates will be applied, relying on returned weights coefficients compared between each set of records.</p>

<h3>Drop your DAX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The world of DAX and tabular models opens up some unique opportunities for some really creative modelling to allow the addressing of both technical and business issues. During this session we will look at a number of different real life scenarios including things like: 

* I need to do a quick proof of concept with some new facts that only has business keys, yet my dimensions have surrogate keys coming from the Data Warehouse which is tracking changes over time (SCD2).

* My users want to look for customers which have certain combinations of products, but not others. i.e "Show me customers who have Product 1 and Product 2, but not Product 3" - How can I support those sort of questions from my tabular model.

* and a couple of other in</p>

<h3>Hour of Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI is Microsoft's exciting new self-service business intelligence (BI) solution delivered through Excel and Office 365. Using Power BI, business users can discover, combine, model, analyse and visualize data through the creation of immersive BI solutions, share them with other users, and access them from anywhere, on any device.

In this session, Rod will focus on;
1.	What is Power BI?
2.	How does Power BI differ to traditional BI tools such as Analysis Services, Reporting Services  PerformancePoint Services?
3.	What do you need to run Power BI, and how do you get it?
4.	Where does Power BI fit in an organization's broader enterprise BI strategy?

In addition to answering the above questions, Rod will build a Power BI solution from scratch, in real time. Rod will use Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View and Power Map inside Excel 2013, before deploying the solution to a Power BI site in the cloud, and interacting with it using Q  A, the new natural language query techno</p>

<h3>Analytical Data Mining - Using Data Mining to Understand Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data mining is a technique used to derive previously unknown information from large amounts of data. The process of this knowledge discovery can help uncover new patterns within data and help analysts better understand the large datasets. Additionally, once these patterns have been defined, you can use them as part of predictive modelling estimating the likelihood of some event occurring.

SQL Server Analysis Services includes a data mining engine that can be used at various levels within an organization, from analyst to developer. This session will look at data mining as tool for data investigation by the business analyst.  We examine the business case, requirements and outcomes of data mining so that it can enhance our understanding of datasets. We will look at both simple and complex implementations of data mining that allow new information to be extracted from data and used in novel ways within the MS Stack.</p>

<h3>Leveraging SQL Spatial Analytics for Making Business Decisions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Imagine the possibilities if you were able to gather real-time insight into the traffic flow, patterns and behaviors of people while within your premises. Wi-Fi Location Analytics solutions leverage WiFi infrastructure to make this possible by capturing high volume real-time spatial positioning data from mobile devices. The spatial data is extracted, transformed and analysed in SQL Server to provide location based mobility services (such as tracking, mapping and way-finding)This session discusses how these Big Data solutions work and demonstrates data consumption via SQL 2012 spatial (direction, distance, speed, proximity), SSRS 2012 custom maps, and Excel Power View. </p>

<h3>Automating Deployments with Powershell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Some aspects of SQL Server installations are easily repeatable using things like config files and command line installs.    However, so much of the preparation and post-install configuration still needs to be done manually.

This session will show how Powershell can be used to prep the servers (including how easy it can be to deploy a cluster) and how Powershell can then be used to deploy and configure SQL Server according to your company standards.</p>
