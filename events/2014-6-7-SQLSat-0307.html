<h3>That's Not in My Job Description: The Accidental Developer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>By now most everyone is familiar with the term "Accidental DBA".  They are the people who for one reason or another, and usually by no choice of their own, wind up being their company's DBA by default.  But what about the reverse of that situation? You could be happily installing, configuring and maintaining SQL Server, taking care of backups, restorations, setting up HA and DR and then all of a sudden your boss asks you to write some code.  It could be a complex report using SSRS, it could be an SSIS package, a small data entry intranet web app or a dashboard. DON'T PANIC.  In this session we will show you how use the skills that you have developed as a SQL Server DBA, along with other free tools that are available to you, and show you how to make coding easier than you thought!</p>

<h3>Implement a Dynamic Table Partitioning Solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have a large or potentially large database that you would like to partition?  Manually implementing partitioning and the corresponding maintenance can be a lot of work, especially if you have many tables.  In this presentation we look at how you would implement a partitioning solution dynamically for all tables with the designated partition column.  We set it up to keep a FIXED number of file groups.  The partition maintenance will recycle the file groups over time as partitions are dropped and created.  We do as much as possible through dynamic scripting.  This solution can easily be used for archiving but in this example we are simply keeping the most current 6 months of data and dropping the rest.  Assumes you have a basic understanding of SQL Server table partitioning.</p>

<h3>Scary Things A Database Owner Can Do</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you've setup your new SQL Server instance and it’s time to start adding databases to it.  You followed security best practices at the instance level, but what about security within each database?  Is that something you can control?  Well, if like me, you work in a shop that mostly purchases software, then having users with database owner permissions is a reality, and likely not one you can change.  But members of the db_owner role can only make changes that would adversely impact their own databases, right?  Think again. During this session we’ll review some common database level settings and actions which can have a negative impact across the entire instance.  We’ll discuss ways to mitigate these risks and monitor for their occurrence.  Come learn how to not let poor choices made by a database owner impact your entire instance.</p>

<h3>Are You Maintaining Your SQL Servers?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you performing all of the regular maintenance you should on your servers?Do you not run CHECKDB because "it takes too long"? How about Index Maintenance - does that take too long?Do you really have the appropriate backups in place?Do you have benchmark numbers in place to compare when your server is "slow"?Come discuss the answers to these and other questions - we will discuss the free Maintenance Solution scripted tools from Ola Hallengren and how they can help you fix these and other problems with a little easy coding you can do yourself. We will also discuss other tips and tricks to help you maintain and troubleshoot your SQL Server instances.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.</p>

<h3>Designing a Restore Strategy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you back up your databases? If the answer is yes (and I really hope it is), do you test your restores? If a table gets dropped at 1:53PM, can you restore the database to 1:52PM using log backups? Can you use the WITH STANDBY parm to apply log backups to a read-only copy of a database?For the answers to these questions and a whole lot more about database restores, plus some nifty scripts, join me for this presentation.</p>

<h3>Yesterday I Couldn’t Even Spell ‘DBA’.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Referred to as “DBA by Default” or “Reluctant DBA”, many people are faced with the situation of suddenly becoming a SQL Server database administrator.  Once the initial shock passes they realize that they need help. This is a great place to start finding resources! The abundance of SQL Server books and websites that exist, some good and some not so good, might only increase confusion leading to panic and rash decisions. DON’T PANIC! In this session we will cover ways to address basic problems and offer some suggestions for finding good places to find help. </p>

<h3>The Curious Case of Isolation Levels</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever seen or used “WITH (NOLOCK)” in T-SQL? Do you know what it does and its side effects? Is SQL Server optimistic or pessimistic when it comes to locking? Can it be both? In this session we will cover these questions and discuss how and why SQL Server takes locks and how that affects other users. We will go over alternatives for using NOLOCK and discuss when it is appropriate to use. In addition, we will discuss what are the ACID properties and how to monitor locks and blocks.</p>

<h3>How to Argue with Your Infrastructure Admins – and Win</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you feel like you spend hours going round-and-round with your system, storage, and virtualization administrators over SQL Server best practices? Are their application-agnostic requirements hurting your SQL Server’s performance, or worse, their reliability? David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable insight into how to start and work through the common conversations with them on the SQL Server infrastructure practices that matter to you the most, and how to succeed in getting what you need while keeping everyone happy.</p>

<h3>Managing SQL Server Performance with Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of a DBA's primary responsibilities is managing the performance of a SQL Server environment. When performance problems arise, DBAs need to have the correct tools in place to be able to dig in and discover the issues that are occurring. Although it's one of the newer tools in the DBA toolbox, Extended Events is one of the most powerful tools available. In this session, we will discuss performance management responsibilities for DBAs and provide a foundation, through Extended Events, to understand and resolve performance issues.</p>

<h3>Add SSIS to the developer tool belt without adding to the DBA’s work load Part 1 (for the DBA)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS is a powerful tool for this but up until SQL 2012 it has been cumbersome in deployment and for security issues for both the developers and DBAs alike. How is SSIS 2012 different than past versions? This session will discuss the various SSIS deployment modes focusing on the new project deployment model. We will walk through several examples. Using a Hosted SSIS server and the project deployment model empowers the developer to view SSIS as self-service SQL feature and not chore to have to coordinate with the DBA.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Features That Will Blow Your Mind!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many lines of code does it take to generate a running total?  How would you find a value in the next row of data - without using a cursor or loop?  How can you efficiently store rows of data with a lot of optional fields, and how can you quickly find which of those rows have values?  And how can you eliminate locking without resorting to dirty reads?  SQL Server has answers for all of these questions, and none requires more than a few lines of code.  Give me an hour, and I will blow your mind!</p>
