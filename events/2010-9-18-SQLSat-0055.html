<h3>Reducing the impact of database changes on an app</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The session is about domain driven development. It seems most ORM frameworks being out there do not really solve the abstraction problem between the two as these are table centric. Do such really follow SOA principles when it comes to treating the db? Empower your next project with... server side ORM. I will let you deeply rethink what you've done so far.
 
My approach let me save days or weeks of otherwise wasted development hours when it comes to "make a change". You might feel ORM of your choice seem let you kickstart the project faster, but then... every major change and tweak here and there is a nightmare (refactor, recompile, retest, redeploy). Rewriting an app after every change is like working one step forward, two step backwards.</p>

<h3>SQL Design Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>atterns emerge as both templated solutions to recurring problems and designs, as well as provide useful ways to encapsulate complex ideas into smaller, friendlier terms. Patterns gained popularity in the object-orientated community since the Fowler and the Gang Of Four, but declarative languages, like SQL, have had little-to-no coverage of how these patterns can be applied. Understanding SQL design patterns is a crucial skill every SQL developer must learn and use in their career. SQL patterns can be applied to small projects or large, multi-million dollar systems, to provide common solutions to complex problems. Patterns create a foundation for "best practices" for SQL, Database Architecture, managers.</p>

<h3>Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting.</p>

<h3>Implementing Fine-grained Data Security</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data security presents a challenge for many groups in a company. Application requirements often specify different data content for various users, while those responsible for security recognize the need to limit access as much as possible.  Available options typically involve trade-offs in security, flexibility, and added work. SQL Server provides a number of security features, but row-level security is missing.  This session will consider some current architectural approaches to implementing flexible data security, and then examine a packaged solution for SQL Server to effectively customize row and column access for users without login accounts.</p>

<h3>SQL at the Speed of Flash </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Solid-state technologies are changing the way that MS SQL users run their databases. DBA’s are achieving significant performance increases using solid state storage.  The bottom line: SQL runs 4-10x faster on solid state.  This session will discuss the various solid-state storage options with their pros and cons. This session will provide practical knowledge around the use of solid state storage for databases and will use real-world use cases to demonstrate the performance advantages of using solid state.</p>

<h3>Ace the Interview</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Job Search: Too often what separates us from the job we want is that we don't do HOW to interview.  Sadly, if you don't know how to do something, you will probably not do it well.  This session is designed to give you the inside track on what employers are looking for and includes an interactive hands-on portion where you can hone your interviewing skills. </p>

<h3>Database "Insecurity"</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We all know that database security is important.  Data is the lifeblood of modern business.  Moreover, Microsoft has given us tremendous tools for securing our databases at the database level.  Yet, how many database developers and database administrators use them?  How many understand them?  Database security is woefully neglected.  There are relatively few articles published on database security.  There are no new books on database security.  Compare this with the tremendous number of books, articles and conferences on Network Security.  Yet, our databases are vulnerable.  This is a call to action.</p>
