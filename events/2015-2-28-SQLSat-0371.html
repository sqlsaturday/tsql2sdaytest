<h3>Turbocharge Your Career With a Learning Plan</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What will you learn next quarter and why? How will you learn it? How much time and money will it cost? What is the ROI on learning those skills? Those are the questions that you answer by building a learning plan and, if you do it well, you’ll find yourself steadily pulling away from your peers.

It starts with a learning list, a place to capture skills you think you need to learn. That’s where you score each topic by estimating the effort to learn it in time and money and the value it adds to your career now and later. It’s absolutely an analog process, but it gives you the framework for answering one question: what do I learn next and why?

Once you’ve picked a topic, how do you learn more about it? Do you read blogs, buy books, or attend a class? Or all of the above? How much time makes sense? Join this session and learn how to dig into the topic to answer the questions that lead to a learning plan. After that, it’s just a matter of executing the plan!</p>

<h3>DevOps for the DBA - Bridging the Gap Between Infrastructure, Administration, and Development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is a term that has come to mean many things to many people. At its core, this important concept represents a way to remove old barriers between the infrastructure, application, and development tiers within an IT organization. An understanding of scripting and automation platforms is becoming a critical skill for SQL Server Database Administrators. Additionally, as hardware is increasingly virtualized, new opportunities for scripted deployment and configuration are available. This session will utilize demos to illustrate the many ways SQL Database Administrators can automate routine tasks from deployment through configuration.</p>

<h3>Introducing Cube World To Users From Flat Table Land</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session explores the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for those DBAs and developers who are more comfortable working with relational databases than cubes. Starting with a ‘normal’ relational database, the attendee will learn how to build a basic model by loading data from several data sources, establish relations between these data sources, define measures and dimensions, build hierarchies, create KPIs and deploy functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with their data. For users already familiar with PowerPivot, this session provides a good transition into the world of SSAS as both use essentially the same techniques.</p>

<h3>Friendlier Data Profiling with the SSIS Data Profiler Task</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SSIS Data Profiler Task contains great functionality, but is not very flexible nor dynamically configurable. Worse, it outputs to xml files only. In this session I will demonstrate an SSIS solution which uses dynamic expressions to flexibly configure what is profiled. The solution also writes to a custom database instead of xml, enabling trending, auditing and reporting. The solution will be made available to attendees. </p>

<h3>Sentiment Analysis with Big Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>People’s sentiments and opinions are written in social networks. There are tweets, Facebook posts, book reviews, forum discussions, and more. These attitudes and feelings are communicated using text, with format depending on the social network. Twitter messages are limited to 140 characters and use hash-tags,; Facebook messages can be longer. This session reviews the different Natural Language Processing, text mining, and data mining techniques you can use for sentiment and tone analysis. Organizations can use the extracted knowledge for brand reputation, market predictions, and automatic learning. We’ll look at, Hadoop, data mining, Microsoft Big Data Hadoop distribution HDInsight and Azure Machine Learning</p>

<h3>Real World SQL Server Administration with just a bit of sysadmin</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly difficult to allow SQL Server database administrators to retain sysadmin permission 24x7x365 on production servers due to IT Security, Audit, and Compliance concerns.

This session will review the fundamentals needed  to define a configurable permission model that allows your company’s DBAs to do routine work without them having unfettered access to business data.  Several demonstrations will prove that many DBA tasks can be done without sysadmin access. Attendees will also learn how to deploy a permission model that allows DBAs to do routine work, elevate DBA permissions quickly to respond to production emergencies and how to grant sysadmin permissions during disaster recovery scenarios. Scripts will be reviewed and demonstrated that secure the database server and that can undo the permission model in case of unforeseen circumstances.

<h3>APPLY Yourself</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Wait Types and Response Time Analysis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using Response Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means.

<p>Are you a DBA who knows nothing or very little about .NET? It's a more common than you might think, but most DBA's cringe at the thought of seeing C# code. Still, there are a lot of gems in this tried and tested toolbox. In this session, we'll cover the portions of .NET that are useful for any data professional. If you're into database development, administration, or ETL - .NET has some useful implementations that you can leverage easily.

No .NET experience is needed for this session. Basic understanding of programming concepts such as if/then logic and loops is suggested.</p>
