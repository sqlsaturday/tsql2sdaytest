<h3>Query Processing in In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is the most important new feature in SQL Server 2014, and this session will teach you how query processing and optimization work with this new database engine. After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained.</p>

<h3>How to tune your applications before moving your database to Microsoft Azure SQL Database (PaaS)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>OK, you've jumped into your Azure journey by creating your Azure SQL Database. Created your schema and filled up your data or just used import/export wizard. Then, you've plugged your application(s) to this new Azure SQL Database but something goes wrong by means of performance. It was working perfectly ok when your database was running on your on premises SQL Server. But now it does not perform very well with Azure SQL Database and your users started reporting interesting error message that you did not see before. "What could it be wrong ?" Some possible answers you may think of are : 
A) This Azure SQL Database thingy is not for me, I give up!
B) I guess I'm missing some details

If you are answering this as "B", plase come join us to learn what you could have been missing

<h3>Scaling Out Microsoft Azure SQL Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure SQL offers a variety of service tiers and performance levels to fit the diverse needs of database applications in the cloud. For each tire, the maximum database size is limited (up to 500GB), so when additional resources are required scaling out becomes necessary. This requires sharding, which horizontally partitions data across multiple databases.  Each database in this model is referred to as a shard.
Azure SQL Database supports three methods to implement sharding: Elastic Scale, Custom Sharding and Federations
This talk is a comparison and overview of these approaches, to be possible to choose the best one in your practice.</p>

<h3>Deep dive to SQL Server configuration for SharePoint Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you're using SQL Server 2012 or SQL Server 2014 as the database server for SharePoint 2013, you must perform particular set of steps to install SQL Server and then configure it specifically to host your SharePoint 2013 farm. In this session, we’ll walk through the installation process for SQL Server. I'll explain the post-installation configuration changes that are foreseen to SharePoint 2013. We’ll also have a look on how to configure SQL as SharePoint backups – all via PowerShell - for sure! As last point bottlenecks for HA/DR environments will be explained in a few steps.

After this session you will serve admirably the database back end to your SharePoint 2013 farm.</p>

<h3>How to improve SQL query performances by analyzing the cached code in buffer pool</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance improvement of T-SQL code is one of the most recurring topic. SQL Server provides developers with a very rich source of information to understand performance issues and bottlenecks: the plan cache.
The session shows a technique for deeply exploring SQL Server plan cache, in order to identify the less performing queries by automatically analyze the XML execution plans through XQuery scripts. It shows the metrics for query plan quality evaluation, how to automatically find the most expensive plans, the less performing operators, and possible optimizations suggested directly by the engine.
More in general, how to identify the most resource consuming pieces of code in order to provide the developers and DBAs with precise indications in terms of code design and maintenance. Finally, the session shows news about SQL 2014 to facilitate this approach.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Document DB and Azure Search</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure Document DB is a purpose built JSON document database that is ideal for use in developing the next generation of modern web and mobile applications. DocumentDB provides the scale and performance of benefits of a NoSQL database but without forcing developers to take a productivity hit at design time in order to use it. NoSQL databases bring the promise of near limitless scale out and improved developer productivity
 
In this session we'll deep dive into the capabilities that set DocumentDB apart from RDBMS stores as well its NoSQL.
This session will focus on the recently announced Azure Document DB service, a powerful JSON store well suited to building modern web and mobile applications and a free tour of NoSQL storage options in Microsoft Azure. Guidance on selecting the right storage will be covered through best practices.</p>

<h3>Effective T-SQL. To be effective or not to be.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Almost any database query can be written in several ways. T-SQL, as any other query language, contains many language constructions and has a lot of aspects, that can both make life easier and more complex. Under "complex life", I understand bad readability and poor performance. In this session we will consider a number of typical tasks, solved with the help of T-SQL, and will look at effective and ineffective task solutions.</p>

<h3>Predictive Modelling with SQL Server and Azure ML</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Nowadays there is no meaning : Big Data if you are digging. The important thing is how can we find a benefits of our business strategy using our structured or non-structured data.

<h3>How Latch Contention Affects the Performance? Common Scenarios and Workarounds from the Field</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Latches are lightweight synchronization primitives that are used by the SQL Server engine to guarantee consistency of in-memory structures including; index, data pages and internal structures such as non-leaf pages in a B-Tree. Latch contention occurs when multiple threads concurrently attempt to acquire incompatible latches to the same in-memory structure. In this session, you will learn what SQL Server Latch Contention is and how to diagnose it. The session will also cover the common application designs and access patterns lead to latch contention and what the possible workarounds are.</p>
