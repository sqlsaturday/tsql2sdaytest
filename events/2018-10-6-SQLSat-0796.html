<h3>Keeping Your DBA Happy. Why Some Practices Drive Admins Crazy.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever used a NOLOCK hint, only to find that nothing broke the next day? Odds are most folks reading this have. So if fire and brimstone did not rain from the sky, why do we worry so much about this hint? What could actually go wrong?

SQL Server supports two table types - heaps and tables with clustered indexes. We almost always create a unique clustered index on tables ... but why? Since heaps are part of the product they must have a use case but what is it? Any what is the secret sauce in clustered indexes that makes them so popular?

There is a substantial body of best practice information in the SQL Server community. Many of these practices are routinely ignored in some organizations, presumably because the consequences of not following aren't always clear. Come join this full day session for in-depth explanations of _why_ we give some of the advice that we do.

Query hints, indexing, LINQ to Entities, common table expressions, looping vs set-based operations and more</p>

<h3>Consumption Based Architecture and MSBI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As the tools available for BI and data warehousing continue to improve, it should change the way we ultimately deliver BI solutions. Microsoft's BI solutions help us keep data closer to the source. As data and BI architects, we need to design solutions that can support this model. Consumption Based Architecture is one such architecture. The goal of this architecture is to plan and design solutions that minimize ongoing maintenance and enable users quicker and more complete access to data. Some highlights are how tabular models and Power BI support this process and where does MDM for BI fit in. Ready to discuss the "death of enterprise data warehouses"? Join the conversation in this session.</p>

<h3>Locking and its effects on queries and maintenance tasks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Multi-user systems are affected by how SQL Server locks resources to manage concurrent transactions. Understanding how SQL Server uses locks to isolate transactions from one another is important for both writing code and running maintenance tasks. 

In this session, we will discuss lock modes in SQL Server and how they impact your queries. We will show how different isolation levels change which locks are taken and for how long they are held. We will look at ways to avoid unnecessary blocking for maintenance tasks like index rebuilds. Assertions will be backed up with demo-based evidence.

After this session, you will have the understanding you need to start writing application code and maintenance jobs suitable for concurrent systems by anticipating blocking issues due to locking.</p>

<h3>Intermediate Security in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many times have you been told by your customers:

* "just grant db_owner/sysadmin to my application and it will work"
* "I need to be able to issue raw DML against these tables"
* "my login doesn't work the way it should!"
* "this query that is accessing objects in multiple databases isn't working"

In this session, we'll talk about ways to service requests like these without
having to give away the world.  We’ll start with authentication and
authorization, for context.

We will then go into different methods to augment the "normal" means of

<h3>Getting Started with Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events. Many DBAs continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years. Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them. Since then, it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way. You may never go back to Profiler again!</p>

<h3>Data Security for the Cloud</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you moved your application to the cloud? Are you thinking about it? Great! Now… how are you securing it?

Security becomes paramount when you move your data to the cloud - after all, it is a much more public resource than the corporate network you’re accustomed to using. Depending on the platform you choose, the vendor may take care of part of the security needs, but they don’t handle all of them. So what, exactly, is your responsibility? And where do you start?

Microsoft MVP Ed Leighton-Dick will answer these questions and more in this full-day workshop on how to best secure your data in the cloud. Topics will include the most common vulnerabilities your data will face on a cloud platform; differences between the current offerings on the major cloud platforms; and the implementation of technical necessities like authentication, encryption, connection security, and monitoring.</p>

<h3>Plan Cache performance tuning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we'll discuss ways to manage execution plans inside the plan cache of busy and unpredictable SQL Servers. The plan cache keeps SQL Server healthy, but all it takes is one bad execution plan to decrease server performance.

Just like gardening, keeping a database healthy requires pruning.  Techniques to manage, remove, and improve performance in the Plan Cache will be shown. The Query Store gives us power tools for this work, but it's not the entire solution.</p>

<h3>Why should I care about ... the plan cache?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs often seem so frazzled. This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</p>

<h3>Three Steps to Lasting Encryption</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve encrypted your data! You’ve used the latest techniques. It’s strong. It’s safe. You’re done, right? Not so fast. Encryption gets weaker with age - keys are lost, algorithms are cracked, techniques become obsolete. In time, the system breaks down, rendering your data either irretrievable or unprotected.

To keep your encryption at full strength, you need to add three practices to your regular maintenance schedule. First, backup your keys frequently and securely to ensure you can always retrieve the data you’ve encrypted. Second, rotate your keys regularly to limit your exposure due to a lost or compromised key. Third, add an encryption key management solution (like Azure Key Vault) to make managing large numbers of keys easier or to enable someone else to manage the keys. In this session, we’ll discuss how you can implement each of these practices in your own environment.</p>

<h3>SQL Sprawl - How to get a handle on your Infrastructure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This Session will give you the tools to assess your existing SQL Deployments, physical or virtual.  
Determine what’s being installed without (or without) your knowledge.  
How are they being utilized resource wise and how are they licensed.
Then determine what can be combined, right sized or retired and does your existing licensing make sense.
This will provide a road-map to make a case for virtualization (if you’re not there yet) or just to get a handle on your SQL Sprawl.</p>

<h3>Database Backup and Restore Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Backups are a vital part of any DBA's job. Acting as the "last line of defense", we rely on backups to safeguard the company's most important asset: the data. But how do we know we're managing our backups appropriately? This session will cover the fundamental principles of building out our backup (and restore strategy), covering the "why" of backups and best practices for our data protection.

<h3>I deleted 1 billion records, what happened next will shock you!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will give an overview of what Table Partitioning is, how can it be used to move large amounts of data quickly and how can it be used with a data archiving strategy to quickly and easily drop archived data from a table.  We will discuss the practical applications of table partitioning using scripts to generate new table partitions, move a partition to another table and discussion on how this can benefit you.   In this demo heavy session, attendees will be provided with scripts to get setup quickly so they can begin using the strategies to take control of rapid data archival</p>
