<h3>Data Mining Deep Dive: Clustering</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server makes it simple to apply data mining algorithms to a wide variety of data.  Applying the results to business decisions without a thorough understanding of how the algorithms work is dangerous to the bottom line of the business, though.  This session will take one of the algorithms, the Microsoft Clustering Algorithm, and do a deep dive into the mechanics of how it works.  The algorithm is valuable for analyzing data in the fields of marketing, social networks and many others.  The session will also examine the types of data that are valid for clustering.  A demonstration of building a clustering model using SQL Server Analysis Services and viewing the model using the Excel Data Mining Add-In will be given.</p>

<h3>Data Quality Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As the old adage goes, 'Garbage in, garbage out.' Stop spending hours manually cleansing your data, and start using DQS! DQS is the new data 
quality tool provided with SQL Server 2012. By leveraging knowledge bases, you can correct invalid data and improve the quality of your data.

In this session we will cover creating a knowledge base, data cleansing, data matching, and using 3rd party knowledge bases (Reference Data). We will talk about installation, show how to use the DQS tool, and how to integrate DQS into your SSIS packages. After this session you should have a good understanding of what DQS is, how to use it, and how to get started with your own Data Quality initiative.</p>

<h3>A Complete BI Solution in About an Hour! </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this presentation Aaron will cover how to collect data from multiple sources using SQL Server 2012 Integration Services (SSIS). Then he will use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to report detail on that data. After that he will use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to create a KPI. Finally he’ll present that KPI on a dashboard via a web page. The goal of this presentation is to show how seamless the Microsoft Business Intelligence products are. If you’ve only used a few of these products, you’ll appreciate seeing them together all at once. Code will be provided.</p>

<h3>Building BI Solutions with Excel 2013</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you have not experienced building BI solutions with Excel 2010, be amazed at what you can do in Excel 2013.  In this session we will use PowerPivot, Power View, Quick Explorer, and other great features in Excel to build an Excel 2013 BI solution.  Microsoft has went "all-in" with Excel as their primary BI client.  If you want to get a first hand look at using it more fully, you will be amazed.  I know I was.</p>

<h3>Discovering the Plan Cache</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

<h3>Flipping Through the SSIS Catalag</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SQL Server 2012 one of the biggest changes for SSIS Administration was the addition of the Integration Services Catalog and using parameters. The Catalog is the storage and logging location for SSIS 2012. Parameters are the new configurations in SSIS 2012 and once you start using them you will never go back. Package Variables, Configuration Strings, Package properties can all be configured using Parameters. You will learn how to create the catalog, use parameters to deploy packages through different environments and use the built in reporting to monitor packages as they run.

<h3>Database Health and Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Sure, your SQL Server is up and running. Is it healthy? Is it performing the best that it can? Where are your performance bottlenecks? In an emergency, can you objectively demonstrate where a performance problem lies? This dynamic dialog session will present a solid process for checking your environment's overall health and performance levels as well as solutions for common problems. Some of the items focused on include dynamic management views (DMVs), Windows Perfmon, and disk performance tools such as IOMeter and SQLIO.</p>

<h3>Index Options You're Not Using</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are index options in SQL Server that can enhance the performance of your queries - but most likely, you aren't using them! If you have a solid knowledge of index basics and want to add to your collection, this is the session for you! I'll show you how filtered indexes, compressed indexes, and indexed views work and can improve performance!

<p>What is Table Partitioning?  How can it be used to enhance performance?  How can it be used with a data archiving strategy to quickly and easily drop archived data from a table?  We will discuss the practical applications of table partitioning using scripts to generate new table partitions, move a partition to another table and discussion on how this can benefit you. </p>

<h3>An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS.  However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case.

After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server.  We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate.

Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!</p>
