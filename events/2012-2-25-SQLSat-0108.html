<h3>SQL Server Reporting Services - Beyond the Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’re already familiar with your data sources and datasets, and already comfortable with your basic tables and matrices. Now you want to add a bit more “zing” to your reports. In this presentation we will look different ways of using and extending Reporting Services.

In this session we will work with expressions to add dynamic components to SSRS, create drilldowns and drillthroughs, use custom code to modularize our logic, connect to non-SQL Server data sources, and utilize your geospatial data by plotting them onto SSRS maps. We’ll include a few more cool stuff you might not have known about SSRS!

This presentation will be demo-filled. You'll be sure to go home with ready-to-use tricks up your sleeve.

<h3>PowerShell for Data Professionals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve heard it said, “If you have to do it twice, automate it.” Cut the learning curve and get a real handle on this powerful automation tool. This session walks you through a dozen scripts to simplify and easily automate time-consuming and tedious elements of your day to day job. This isn’t stuff you’ll use SOMEDAY, these are scripts you can use when you get home tonight. Harness the power of Power Shell to easily find Servers short on space. Script out tables and constraints across all of your databases at once. Backup databases and restore them to a different environment. These tricks and many others will allow PowerShell to simplify your job like no other tool.

<h3>Database lifecycle with Visual Studio 2010 and TFS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you tired of manually integrating scripts before every release, inadequate history of changes to database objects or lack of consistent and automated unit testing for SQL Server objects?
We will learn how we can use Visual Studio 2010 Database Project and Team Foundation Server for managing lifecycle of our database projects. Session will cover basic rules for managing tables, views and stored procedures in Visual Studio project, using Team Foundation Server source control and creating unit tests.
We will also use TFS build agent to automate creation of the differential SQL scripts, deploying it to test/development environment and execution of defined unit tests.
Finally we will create deliverables for release.</p>

<h3>Unleashing Common Table Expressions in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to create a recursive query, but didn't see how to do it.  With the Common Table Expressions class you will learn everything needed to start using CTE's for recursive queries, as a temporary views, and to use the result set multiple times in the same query.  Learn how simplify query syntax using CTE's.  One of the most overlooked features of SQL Server is the CTE which no only simplifies the query, but gives you the ability to do things that would otherwise be impossible (or at least very challenging) with SQL Server.  This presentation is targeted for database programmers and administrators who are familiar with TRANSACT SQL, Subqueries, and advanced join techniques.</p>

<h3>Database Development: Keep It Agile, Not Fragile</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Does your company use agile development? It can deliver more value to customers with lower project risk.  However, it can also make the system design change rapidly, and require frequent software rollouts. This session will  focus on best practices for DBAs and developers to make design, testing and deployments easier. Keep your systems agile, not fragile!

<h3>PowerShell 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you haven't dug in to PowerShell at this point, you're missing out on some amazing, powerful, practical stuff that could save you time every day. PowerShell does have a learning curve at the outset, especially for those not already familiar with OO concepts or programming in a language like C#, so this introductory session will go through the very basics of PowerShell syntax. If that collection of pipes and hyphens and curly braces seems to be written in some incomprehensible foreign language, this session is for you. At the end of the session you should have a grasp of how and why a PowerShell script does what it does, and the confidence to dig in deeper and begin using POSH scripts in your own work.</p>

<h3>Basic Performance Tips and Gotchas</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Forget Profiler for a second, I have seen one poorly placed index bring an enterprise database to its knees. We will cover the basic tips of performance which always work and the ones which always fail. What can you do – and what should you do –when it comes to the most common types of indexes so you always make the right move. We will use lessons from SQL Architecture Joes 2 Pros Vol3.</p>

<h3>Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on
the market. But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy. And it doesn’t mean that
database administration on SQL Server is problem free. And since SQL Server is constantly
growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues
that others had tackled and solved years ago. Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails
of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. In
fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?

<h3>The Elephant in the Room (Hadoop for DBAs)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The rapidly evolving worlds of cloud and big data are producing a wide variety of new computing and storage platforms beyond the relational paradigm.  This includes Not-Only SQL (noSQL) data stores, such as MongoDB and Cassandra, to distributed data management and computation ecosystems such as Hadoop.  

This session will explore the key technology gaps and drivers behind this shift, and examine the pros and cons of various tools and approaches.

This will encompass hands-on demonstrations, real world applications and how best to leverage these new platforms in conjunction with SQL Server.

<h3>Merge Replication for High Availability</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Load balancing web servers between database servers enables high availability when using merge replication. When one data center has a power failure, the HVAC is down or other disaster, the web hosting and databases at the other data center can take over new connections along with the existing connections and continue with the entire load. Upgrades and equipment maintenance are more convenient when another data center can easily take over. There are limitations and specific procedures for setup and maintenance. Discover the benefits and caveats of merge replication.</p>

<h3>Advanced indexing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!I will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries, But I will also show the dangers of using too many indexes, and the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes.</p>

<h3>Replication Magic: Initializing From Backups</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you work with very large databases (VLDBs) that must be replicated, you should be using initialization from backup. There are a some misconceptions the have caused DBAs to assume that they could not use initialization from backup. In this session I will explore those misconceptions and prove that they are incorrect.

Demos will include initializing a subscriber from a transaction log backup and performing a partial restore of a database and initializing the subscriber from the partial backup.</p>

<h3>Parallel Task Scheduling with T-SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It's not so difficult to write a stored procedure to execute number of tasks (SQL statements) sequentially and/or conditionally. However, things will become complex when you decide to run the code blocks within the procedure from different sessions concurrently with desired ordering and definable degrees of parallelism. In this session, we will discuss different ways to implement thread schedulers, semaphores, synchronizations, and process ordering as well as process monitoring and manipulation by using pure T-SQL.</p>
