<h3>Practising Safe Custom Visuals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Custom visuals provide further extension to Power BI’s already awesome visual palette and there are some incredibly useful and beautiful visuals available out there in the world. You can also install visuals directly from files you build yourself, or built by others.

While you should ideally be able to trust that custom visuals are improving your ability to tell your data story, it’s often worth knowing exactly what these can and can’t do with respect to your data so that you can make informed decisions around the right ones to use.

In this session, we’ll talk about considerations to make when selecting custom visuals for your reports, what potential pitfalls to look out for when evaluating them (including demonstration of a “black hat” custom visual), and how to manage usage policies for custom visuals by your users at an enterprise level.</p>

<h3>Architecting Microsoft Azure Data Platform Solutions Correctly</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Migrating SQL Server databases into Microsoft's Azure platform has proven to be problematic for a number of organizations. Solution architect's do not necessarily understand all the different PaaS and IaaS offerings, or their implications to operationalization and cost/licensing. As a result a lot of organization implement sub-optimal/incorrect solutions or experience "sticker shock" at the end of their first year in the cloud. Migrating your SQL Server databases into the cloud is easy! Migrating your SQL Server databases into the cloud correctly is potentially not so easy. In this pre-con we examine how to correctly architect your transition into the cloud from an architectural perspective, yet also focus on performance, security, operationalization and cost (of course). The pre-con will focus on the following SQL Database, SQL Elastic Pools, SQL Managed Instance, SQL Hyperscale, SQL DW. We will also touch upon Cosmos DB, Data Lake, Data Factory, Analysis Services and Power BI. Wow!</p>

<h3>Jupyter Notebooks for DBAs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks were once the realm of Data Scientists. New releases of Azure Data Studio, Visual Studio Code, and .NET interactive tooling have brought this tooling into the Operational team's area. The biggest benefit of using Jupyter Notebooks is that you have your documentation, your code __and__ your results in the same source controllable document.

Spend a day with me, and I will share with you all of the knowledge I have gained over the past 12 months implementing Jupyter Notebooks for Data Operation teams.

You will leave  
- with a good understanding of possible use cases for Jupyter Notebooks
- being comfortable in using the different tooling
- with many examples that you can take back to work and start being effective immediately

Enabling collaboration with your team, simplifying common tasks, improving Incident Wash-Up meetings, creating run-books, easily creating code for others to use are some of the benefits that you will take away. 
We will have fun as well.</p>

<h3>Exploring the ‘people’ element of a Power BI project – its more than just data!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever worked on a dashboard design project where you have been restricted by rules or direction that limit your capacity to create? Or developed a dashboard so awesome and compelling, only to have your manager or client start picking holes in it? If this sounds familiar, then come along to this Power BI session to hear about ways to effectively present and communicate your data by focusing on techniques you can use during the project to meet your objective first time, and reduce the need for re-work. I’ll present Power BI features and techniques that we use at DiscoverEI so that we can work WITH our clients, rather than working FOR our clients. These include how to enhance navigation and context through bookmarks and tooltips, using placeholder visuals to guide direction, utilising the App Workspace and communicating effectively through visual design.</p>

<h3>Developing Cosmos DB for the Enterprise</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Cosmos DB is an awesome multi-model database service that allows us to distribute our data on a global scale. It's fairly easy to get started with Cosmos DB, but when it comes to implementing it for use within our Enterprise applications, there are many things that you will want to consider when developing a Cosmos DB database.

In this session, I'll cover important topics that you'll want to consider when developing and administrating Cosmos DB for Enterprise use, including security considerations, partitioning, provisioning throughput for your databases and collections, distributing your data and much more.

By the end of this session, you should be able to take these learnings and apply them when developing Cosmos DB applications for your business.</p>

<h3>Data Classification and Masking: the What and How of Data Protection</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As organisations make greater use of their data assets across multiple systems and environments, there is an increased risk of exposing unmasked sensitive data. This is particularly a concern when regulations such as GDPR are also in play. 
 
However, copies of data used in dev/test or in analytics need to be an accurate representation of the primary data so omitting, or doing a simple replacement of sensitive values, may skew any results. 
 
This session will introduce tools and processes that can be used to help protect your data. It will firstly show how the Data Classification utility in SSMS and SQL Server can identify and categorize your sensitive data. We will then see how Data Masking can be used to either hide sensitive data from selected users or to completely replace specific classifications of data with new values that both protect the source and also ensure that the distribution of data values remains consistent for your test environments.</p>

<h3>Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.</p>

<h3>DevOps for Azure SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Organizations are increasingly realizing the importance of declarative, everything-as-code approach to managing the software and data lifecycle from development through production. DevOps is a broad term that generally encompasses source code control, collaborative processes including code review, automated unit and integration testing, and continuous deployment. While DevOps has classically been associated with stateless code development, it is technically feasible to apply DevOps principles to databases, thereby increasing consistency, catching and preventing defects earlier, having a declarative approach to deployments, and in general increasing productivity and predictability of operating databases at scale.

Come to this session to learn how to use tools like Visual Studio, Azure DevOps, git, build and release pipelines, etc. for a first-class, modern, and easy-to-use database DevOps experience when working with Azure SQL. You will leave the session equipped with the knowledge and</p>

<h3>Data Virtualization with PolyBase</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.</p>

<h3>When to use Indexing Pro Features</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using the right index for the right scenario can be the "go fast" button that keeps queries and customers happy. 

Over the years, Microsoft has given us many different indexing options and flavors. Today there are many more considerations beyond "clustered or non clustered". We'll cover all those different flavor options: Filtered, Compressed, Columnstore, included columns, and Partitioning. 

We won't only talk about what these options are, we'll also cover how and when to use these different indexing options, and how to make sure you have enough--but not too many--indexes for your workload.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters: Make SQL Server your Data Hub for everything</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS and Spark!

In this session we are going to explore the capabilities of the exciting new feature. How does it work and how can we work with datasets that are non-relational?</p>

<h3>Performance, Optimization, and Intelligent Error Handling in Power Query</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are two cornerstones to building optimized and low maintenance queries in Power BI. The first is making sure queries have been designed to refresh at optimal speeds. Primary topics for performance tuning include: removing columns and rows, applied step configuration and order precedence, query folding, managing variables, and tables vs lists for transformations. The other important cornerstone is intelligently identifying and handling errors as they occur during scheduled refreshes. Primary topics for error handling include: replacing vs removing errors, collecting error metadata, and configuring the refresh to either fail or refresh successfully when errors occur.</p>

<h3>Get Comfortable with Query tuning and Execution Plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Even as many of the traditional DBA activities become automated or managed by Cloud providers, the ability to tune and optimize database query performance remains a desirable and marketable skill.

Central to ability to tune queries is an ability to use information provided from Execution plans, DMVs, Query Store and Extended Events.

In this demo based session we will look into:
- What information is available 
- How it can be used.
- Techniques to improve performance. 

Attendees will leave with an understanding of possibilities of turning queries and a roadmap for further learning.

This session will assume a basic knowledge of T-SQL and execution plans.</p>

<h3>Exploring Window Functions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Windows Functions first emerged with the 2005 release – and were enhanced in 2012.
They provide a window over the result set and the ability to access data other than the current row.
This means that somethings that may  - at first - seem like they need row-by-row processing can be done in one single set-based query.
The set of window functions available also includes server analytical functions that give the ability to perform statistical analysis.
Come along to this session and see a deep dive into window functions and learn how their use will add to your ability to process data and write more efficient – and cleaner – queries.</p>

<h3>DevOps for Databases: 10 steps to failure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Application teams have been drinking the DevOps ‘Kool-aid’ for many years (19 to be precise) and the benefits are undeniably positive. We’ve seen improvements to code quality, faster, more reliable deployments as a result. And yet…many of us assume that because databases are different, they don’t fit this model…didn’t our parents tell us never to assume?

In this session, we’ll use reverse psychology to evidence the steps that will inevitably cause us to fail database DevOps - so we can avoid it!
By knowing what to NOT do, the path becomes clearer, leading your business and your career to a higher ground.</p>
