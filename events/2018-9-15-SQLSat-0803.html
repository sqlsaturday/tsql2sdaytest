<h3>Wading into Stream Analytics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Large volumes of data originate at high velocity from various sources including IoT devices and sensors, web sites and social media feeds. A common approach is to simply store these data for offline processing.

Processing that in many instances never happens...

Wouldn't it be more efficient and effective to process the data stream as it arrives?

Azure Stream Analytics is an event-processing engine which enables processing of streaming data in real time. It can handle up to 1 Gb of data per second, which should suffice for most applications.

In this tutorial I'll take you through the processing of setting up a job on Azure Stream Analytics. I'll look specifically at the following:

- connecting to a data source
- extracting information
- identifying patterns and relationships
- using machine learning
- triggering actions
- reporting tools and
- offline processing.

To illustrate these concepts we'll build a real time sentiment analysis system for streaming data from Twitter.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 on Steroids!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.</p>

<h3>Power BI Report Design for the Aesthetically Challenged</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you're a BI developer, and you've worked hard to get a good knowledge of DAX. Your power BI model is working well, but you're not sure how to present it in a stylish, attractive and appealing way?

Many of us are not blessed with amazing artistic ability, and we find design work be a real challenge. Don't despair, there are some logical patterns and tips we can follow to make big differences in our reports without needing to unleash the artist within.

In this session we'll learn about layout, colour theory, design principles and how to choose the best visualisation for the message you wish to convey.

We'll also take a glance at enhancing our reports by the using bookmarks, tooltips and drillthrough features in Power BI.</p>

<h3>Power BI data preparation with Dataflows</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data preparation is often the most labour-intensive component of an analytics project and getting this right is vital if the results are to be accurate. While the growth of self-service BI has empowered users to answer important questions, ensuring well-managed data is available to all employees remains one of businesses biggest challenges. Dataflows is an extension of the Power BI ecosystem, providing a low code approach using Power Query to create curated datasets that can be easily consumed by business analysts, thereby improving the speed at which business value can be delivered. Dataflows provides a single-version-of-the-truth which was traditionally attained by building a data warehouse. You will learn -How Dataflows can be used to create rich, vetted datasets -How Dataflows can be created with the click of a button, ingesting data from many well knows SAAS solution such as Dynamics and Salesforce -How to manage Dataflows using advanced data preparation tools such as Databricks</p>

<h3>Graphs in SQL Server and Cosmos DB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the new features in SQL Server 2017 was Graph tables. These represent a different way of storing data to what we’re use to in the relational model.
In this session, I’ll take you through the design process for graph tables, and then implement and query some graphs in both SQL Server 2017 and Cosmos DB using its graph model.</p>

<h3>All you wanted to know about CTE's but were afraid to ask</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In today's complex business environment, it is imperative that we provide the decision maker with information in a timely manner. One of the most powerful, efficient and effective ways of achieving our goal is by "working smarter" with our SQL Code. In this presentation we shall be looking and working with cool ways and means of getting the information out of the door, utilizing Common Table Expressions or CTE's to render the necessary data. This is your chance to experience first hand the power of these fantastic structures!! Carpe Diem!!!</p>

<h3>Does everyone hate replication?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Transactional replication has been around for a dogs age and most people have grown to hate the old girl. Not everyone though. Those of us that have applied ourselves to the technology have grown to love it.
This session will walk you through the basics of what replication is, why and when you should use it 
Next we will walk through some of the extra little toys that replication allows:
--)Tweaking the target table
--)Using custom stored procedures rather than standard ones
--)Procedure replication rather than table replication</p>

<p>Rory studied Information technology, ran a small computer shop then found Derivco as a Tester. Moved as soon as possible to Data Development and it has stuck.

Rory really loves wood work, general garage tinkering and has a second child on the way which his wife has told him he is excited about.

Rory's Derivco career has centered around delivering data from 40+ busy source databases to +-120 consumer databases. The main focus in this space is deduplication and compression of data while finding the correct balance between RBAR and batching.
If moving data is your thing, Rory can help.</p>
