<h3>Database Snapshots - Making Your Job Easier</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Want to off load some of that reporting workload, make an emergency rollback during a production upgrade faster, or make managing your test databases easier?  If any of these appeal to you, then you should be familiar with database snapshots within SQL Server.  Available since SQL Server 2005, use of this feature can make your life a lot easier.We'll spend the first part of this session taking an in depth look at how database snapshots work. We’ll look at what exactly is happening behind the scenes when you create a snapshot and when you query a snapshot.  Once we've covered the basics, we'll spend the rest of our time analyzing and discussing a number of real world use cases where snapshots can be very beneficial and save you a great deal of time.</p>

<h3>A Bigger Boat: Data Visualization Lessons From the Movie Theater</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When Chief Brody first sees the shark in Jaws, he carefully backs away from the stern of the Orca and quietly, but certainly, tells Quint, “You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” That one line, combined with a terrific delivery by Roy Sheider, packs a great deal of contextual information into six words.

Making efficient use of space to convey meaning is a vital part of good Data Visualization.

In this session, we will discuss the fundamentals of human visual perception, including the important distinction between Pre-Attentive and Attentive Processing. We will use examples from feature films like Jaws, Alien, and Sneakers to show important aspects of visual analysis around Color, Form, Position, and Motion. We will then put these concepts into practice via demos in Excel and Power BI. By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of the importance of data visualization and how to use it to enable better decisions.

<h3>How to archive your database data in “Stealth Mode”.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I know I should be archiving some of this data.  My boss wants me to archive some of this data.  But the database is so complicated.  It has so many foreign keys. There are so many level of hierarchy.  When could I ever schedule an outage or how can I do this without impacting production.  It’s so risky.  What if I mess up?  

Learn how to design and implement a “Database Archiving Strategy” in a graceful, almost unnoticed manner I call “Stealth Mode”. The method is this. Reverse engineer your database so you know the hierarchy levels of your database.  Determine the sequence order in which tables must  be archive. Use transaction code, include simple double checks. Use indexed temp tables to minimize impact on other tables and to increase performance and speed.  Archive in very small batches that run in 1 to 5 seconds, repeat many times during the lowest activity part of the night.  Never drop and reapply foreign keys.  Minimize locking and blocking and yield to more important tasks.</p>

<h3>Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.</p>

<h3>Effective Reporting through SSRS Advanced Authoring Features </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Effective reporting is not simply the output of data, but the meaningful presentation of that data in a manner that informs the user. SQL Server Reporting Services provides a myriad of features to create a clear, instructive, and interactive experience. This session will demonstrate techniques to utilize SSRS advanced authoring features to facilitate more informative communication. These features include: nesting data regions, leveraging scope, geographic/geometric reporting, complex charting, rich formatting, incorporating managed code assemblies, intuitive drilldown, data from multiple datasets in a single data region, datasets that update source data, and more.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2014, more than just in-memory</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It feels like the only feature of SQL 2014 people talk about is in-memory but SQL Server 2014 has some other really cool features like Buffer Pool Extensions, Resource Governor Improvements, Incremental Statistics, Online Operations Enhancements and more.

<h3>The Plan Cache Whisperer: Performance Tuning SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Execution plans tell SQL Server how to execute queries. If you listen closely, execution plans can also tell you when performance-tuning opportunities exist in your environment.  By listening to your queries, you can understand how SQL Server is operating and gain insight into how your environment is functioning. In this session, learn how to use XQuery to browse and search the plan cache, enabling you to find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries.  In addition, learn how a performance issue on a single execution plan can be used to find similar issues on other execution plans, enabling you to scale up your performance tuning effectiveness. You can use this information to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using which indexes. All this and more is readily available through the plan cache.</p>

<h3>Automated Restore Script Output for Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is designed to be useful to two different audiences:
1.Those implementing Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution for the first time
2.Those that have been using it for awhile, but might have a hole in their DR plan – what to restore when a resource goes offline

We will do an overview of the maintenance solution to start, then get down and dirty quickly with the guts of the extension. What I am presenting is a custom extension that works out of the box for those of you that have created jobs using the maintenance solution. The scripts will add an additional job step to all DatabaseBackup jobs which will output a text file that contains the most current restore scripts for each database in the instance.

<h3>Dimensional Modeling Design Patterns: Beyond the Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dimensional modeling is one of cornerstones of successful business intelligence (BI) initiatives. Even with new technologies such as PowerPivot and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) tabular models, you need to represent your organization’s data in a way that is accessible for end users and IT staff alike. An effective dimensional model can also help to ensure that your data warehouse or data mart is responsive and can accommodate emerging requirements.

This session dives deeper into the art of dimensional modeling. We look at how and when to create different types of fact and dimension tables, including patterns for enriching dimensional data, creating usable hierarchies for efficient navigation, and tracking historical changes. After this session, you will be able to confidently assess the quality of your organization’s dimensional model and recommend and implement changes. Bring your toughest quandaries to this interactive and engaging session.

<h3>It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session, we’ll discuss why you may need temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal support without a true period data type (since SQL Server doesn’t yet have one), and how to query such a table using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement. We will also discuss and demonstrate bi-temporal design, where both system time and application time are supported.

<h3>How to Hack a Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you ever hear about a database hack and think “Wow, whoever pulled this off must be some super-smart hacker type with access to advanced technology and supercomputers?” Well in reality nothing could be further from the truth. Database hacks are accomplished with a combination of readily available tools, a dash of readily available know-how, a large helping of blind luck, and a heaping helping of laziness on the part of the folks who are responsible for securing their systems. It's so easy even I can do it!

In this presentation I will teach you how to hack a database so you can defend your systems against the hackers who want to get at your assets. </p>

<h3>Managing SQL Server Performance with Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of a DBA's primary responsibilities is managing the performance of a SQL Server environment. When performance problems arise, DBAs need to have the correct tools in place to be able to dig in and discover the issues that are occurring. Although it's one of the newer tools in the DBA toolbox, Extended Events is one of the most powerful tools available. In this session, we will discuss performance management responsibilities for DBAs and provide a foundation, through Extended Events, to understand and resolve performance issues.</p>

<h3>Securing data in Microsoft SQL Server - Part-1</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>My experience at many dozens of companies indicates that more than 90% of all database implementations don't follow some of the most fundamental best practices.  Learn to view security differently and how basic builtin features can be leveraged to make your systems both more maintainable and more secure.  Features covered include schema use and a detailed comparison between Ownership Chaining, Execute-As and Certificate Signing.</p>

<h3>Cortana Analytics with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The content is purposefully casual and based around EPL Fantasy Football and sports metrics (for the English premier League). We will explore the use of great new tools such as Power Query, Power Pivot, and subsequently Power BI in order to create the perfect fantasy football team. 

Power BI does not just have to be for the Corporate world. John and Jane should be loving this too.</p>

<h3>Protecting Your Data with Encryption</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We’ve all seen the recent news stories about companies whose data has been stolen by hackers.  What was once a rare event has become all too common, and companies large and small are at risk.  While it isn’t always possible to prevent intrusions, you can reduce the risk by encrypting your data.  In this presentation, I’ll show you the four ways that SQL Server provides to encrypt data: hashes, cell-level encryption, database-level encryption (also known as transparent data encryption), and backup encryption.  We’ll also discuss the keys required for each type of encryption and discuss how to protect the keys themselves.</p>
