<h3>Introducing Azure Data Factory</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Who needs to move data around? Everyone, of course. Whether we're moving data on-premises or in the cloud, Microsoft's Azure Data Factory (ADF) service is a great way to compose and manage the pipelines that transform data inside and between our systems. ADF integrates well with existing Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) frameworks while closing the gaps left by data-UNaware task schedulers. In this introductory, highly-interactive session, you'll learn how ADF can help you visualize, define and manage data as it moves around, no matter whether that's on-premises, in the cloud or in between the two. Even though this is an introductory session, basic familiarity with common ETL and task-scheduling concepts is recommended.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2014/2016 In Memory Technologies - OLTP (aka Hekaton)  ColumnSt</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the advent of new hardware servers with hundreds of Gigabytes of RAM memory and incredibly faster CPUs with multi-core dies Microsoft has catapulted SQL Server above competitors with some new In Memory technologies. Did you ever want to have no locking, no blocking, no latch? For highly transactional systems, In Memory OLTP can boost performance 10x by hosting a table in memory and compiling the stored procedure in C code/DLL. Did you ever wanted to have queries return blazing fast for slow changing data? Updatable ColumnStore index allows for quick results to be returned as massive compression on the column exist and data is kept in RAM. 
Having participated in SQL14/SQL15/Hekaton TAP, I'll be showing demo on both of these technologies, gotchas, best practices.</p>

<h3>The Data Warehouse of the Future</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you think you have the ultimate Data Warehouse...well think again.   The landscape or should I say the data lake is changing constantly.   We are getting data from all over the place.   How do we make it available and relevant for the consumers of a data warehouse.   Is Kimbell obsolete now, what about unstructured data, how about the gazillioin rows of click data, etc.   So the data and BI architects are all on suicide watch.    Well its not really that bad.   Microsoft has woken up and seen all that is going and has brought functionality to SQL Server to solve some of these issues.   This presentation provides an overview of technologies such as Polybase, Temoporal Tables, Columnstore Index, In memory tables, JSON support, etc.   that can be utilized to build the data warehouse of the future.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.</p>

<h3>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort.  Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables?  Need to move 500 databases to a different drive?  Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds.  I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes.  Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you.
Here you’ll learn:
•	The most useful regular expression commands.
•	The appropriate times to use regular expressions.
•	How to use regular expressions to write code for you.
•	How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

<h3>"Can I Get A Report of This?":  Introduction to SSRS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the day-to-day operations of business, how often have we heard or even asked someone the question ourselves, “Can I get a report of this?”  Regardless of your area of expertise, reporting has become a necessity and requirement among businesses and is impacting our roles as IT professionals.  With the huge wave of trendy reporting tools and software surrounding the BI industry, many people are unaware or often overlook SSRS as a reporting solution.  In this session, we will look at the features and capabilities of SSRS, as well as supply you with the tools to begin fulfilling basic report requests.   At the conclusion of this session, you will know the difference between Report Builder and SQL Server Data Tools to determine which one is suitable for your needs.

<h3>Testing SSIS Packages</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error handling</p>

<h3>SQL Server Deprecated and Discontinued Features</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Support for SQL Server 2005 ends in April 2016 - do you still need to upgrade? Each version of SQL Server provides a list of features which are deprecated – meaning they will be removed in a future version – and a list of features previously deprecated which are discontinued in that version. This session will discuss the deprecated\discontinued features starting with SQL 2008 and will show you how to identify deprecated features so that you can upgrade with ease when those features are discontinued in the version to which you are upgrading.</p>
