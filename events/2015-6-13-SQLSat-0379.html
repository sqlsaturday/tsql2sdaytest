<h3>Changing Data Is Easy, Managing Data Change is Hard!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Databases are growing.  The way we use data is changing and growing.  When you have a lot of change, it has to be managed, or bad things happen to your data and your job!  A common problem with database change management is... database change management.  This session walks the user through the concepts of database change management, why it's important, and how SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) makes this process easy.  There are a lot of great features in this frequently overlooked product, and if you are not using it, your job is a lot harder than it needs to be.  Some things we will discuss: schema compare, database versions in source control, renaming objects, and how your job is pushing the button to deliver it the EASY way with SSDT.</p>

<h3>Once Upon a DateTime</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Creating calculated measures and columns in DAX is an essential part of any Tabular or PowerPivot model. Since most data represents events that occur over time, a time dimension is critical in those models to reveal data trends. However, perhaps even more important than just using time as a dimension is using DAX time functions to calculate aggregate measures grouped on discrete time periods such as months, quarters, and years, period to date aggregates, and the analysis of parallel periods to compare the past to the present. For most financial analysis of data, the ability to look at data grouped by different time periods is essential in making good business decisions. Come to our monthly meeting to learn how to use the DAX date functions to successfully analyze data over time. </p>

<h3>We Don't Need Roads: A Look Into SQL Server Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever ran a SQL against SQL Server and it was so slow that you wondered if the database was from 1955? You could use a Delorean or you can create indexes in your database.  This session will introduce you to SQL Server indexes.  Indexes are a powerful tool to improve the performance of our queries. We'll discuss how indexes are structured and why they speed up queries, how INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries are affected by indexes and how to identify if an index is necessary. Then, we'll take a look at an Entity Framework application and see how EF reacts to our fresh new indexes. If you want to make bad query performance a thing of the past this session is for you.

<h3>Entity Framework: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Learned to Love Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have applications in your environment that don't use SQL written by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are the system is utilizing Microsoft's Entity Framework.

Entity Framework (EF) and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is Entity Framework a technology that developers should even be using? In this session, we'll review what Entity Framework is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how Entity Framework works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by Entity Framework. Finally, we'll review T-SQL generated by Entity Framework and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional that manages databases that are accessed through Entity Framework or would like a basic knowledge of how Entity Framework works this session is for you.

<h3>Turbocharge Your Career With a Learning Plan</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What will you learn next quarter and why? How will you learn it? How much time and money will it cost? What is the ROI on learning those skills? Those are the questions that you answer by building a learning plan and, if you do it well, you’ll find yourself steadily pulling away from your peers.

It starts with a learning list, a place to capture skills you think you need to learn. That’s where you score each topic by estimating the effort to learn it in time and money and the value it adds to your career now and later. It’s absolutely an analog process, but it gives you the framework for answering one question: what do I learn next and why?

Once you’ve picked a topic, how do you learn more about it? Do you read blogs, buy books, or attend a class? Or all of the above? How much time makes sense? Join this session and learn how to dig into the topic to answer the questions that lead to a learning plan. After that, it’s just a matter of executing the plan!</p>

<h3>Encryption 101: A look at SQL Encryption Options</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are your backups like a stack of cash free for the taking, or a hardened ATM?  Are your database connections scrambled and safe or are you sending data over the party line?  In this session we will walk through the many ways SQL Server allows us to protect our data using encryption. We will evaluate the various methods for protecting data at rest, in the database, and while in transport.  Since nothing comes for free, we will look at how much all of this is going to cost us, in time, money, and failure to implement. </p>

<h3>An Entity Framework Crash Course for the Busy DBA.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Entity Framework enables developers to work with data in the form of domain-specific objects and properties, without having to concern themselves with the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored. With such great power comes great frustration; Namely our Database Administrators' as they trace through and attempt to optimize the Entity Framework auto-generated SQL statements hitting our databases.

This talk aims to empower the DBA with an understanding of the architecture behind the Entity Framework and the most common pitfalls programmers fall for when attempting to rapidly write data access layer code using the Entity Framework and what can be done to overcome them.</p>

<h3>Calculated Columns, Measures, and KPIs, Oh My!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>To do serious work in a Power Pivot table or even a SQL Analytics Cube, you must know the difference between calculated columns, measures, and KPIs, how to define them, use them, and display them.  This session will take you step by step through the creation of each of these components of a typical pivot table or cube showing you how to define the necessary expressions and then how they are displayed in tables and charts that transform mere data into meaningful managerial information.  To keep examples simple enough for all attendees to go back and try on their own, Excel Power Pivot Tables will be used, but the same techniques apply almost without change to SSAS cubes.</p>

<h3>Easier schema migrations, data migrations  more w/ Redgate tools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Managing data models and data for existing applications can be cumbersome and fraught with pitfalls. Many developers and DBAs rely on "change" scripts they produce manually whenever they need to deploy changes or updates. Though this might work well for small and infrequent changes, it's much harder to pull off with large teams, complex applications or applications that change all the time. In the world of software, we rely on source control and code-differencing tools. However, these tools are much less common when it comes to database schemas and data in databases. Enter RedGate tools: SQL Compare, SQL Data Compare and others. These tools allow the DBA to quickly "compare" databases (even data) and quickly generate "change scripts" that can be used to roll out changes and/or audit databases. In this session, we explore these tools and how I've integrated them in my workflow when supporting business applications. [Note I do not work for Redgate and this is not a vendor session.]</p>
