<h3>Worst Practices  Less Known Limitations for Columnstore Indexes [DE/EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever considered a situation where Columnstore Index can be quite the opposite of what one would expect from it? A slow, wasteful source of painfully slow queries, lagging the performance, consuming irresponsible amount of resources …

Setting the wrong expectations (it won’t run 100 times faster on EVERY query), selecting the wrong architecture (partition by 100s of rows instead of millions), using and aggregating by the large Strings in the fact tables – this list is actually quite large.

What about some of the less known limitations for building Columnstore Indexes? The ones that will bite you suddenly in the middle of the project – when you do not expect it at all?

Let me show you how to achieve those painful mistakes and you will surely know how to avoid them :)</p>

<h3>Comparing Predictive Mining Models from R, Python, SSAS, and Azure ML [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is a lot of overlapping in Microsoft BI suite. For advanced analytics, like data mining, you can use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), or R, or Python, or Azure ML. The question arises which tool to use. The answer is simple, through another question. Why not all of them? 
In data mining, you typically create multiple predictive models for the same task, and then evaluate them to select the best one. So why wouldn’t you even use different tools for different models? You will learn how to evaluate the predictive models. Then you will see how to bring all of the mining models together and compare them no matter of the source they come from. You will see how you can use SQL Server Integration Services, Excel, and other tools for this task.</p>

<h3>Implementing a hybrid data warehouse [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The last couple of years have seen the emergency of "Big Data", "Cloud" and "Internet of Things".  Subsequently, Gartner at the 2016 Gartner Summit in Barcelona declared the Enterprise data warehouse (EDW) as dead. 
Which of course is silly. Sensible companies don't just throw money out of the window.
But they need to adapt and change when new opportunities arrive.
Enter the hybrid data warehouse. Combining the power of big data and cloud with your trusty EDW.

This session will take a look at a few different approaches to a hybrid data warehouse, with components such as SQLServer 2016, Azure Data Lake, HDInsight, Azure Analysis Services, Azure SQL Data warehouse and Polybase, with some scenarios where the approaches might become
 relevant. And some pitfalls you need to know about along the way.</p>

<h3>Advanced insides into System Versioned Temporal Tables [DE/EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 introduces support for system-versioned temporal tables as a database feature that brings built-in support for providing information about data stored in the table at any point in time rather than only the data that is correct at the current moment in time. 

This session takes you behind the basics of Temporal Tables and answers - after a short introduction - the following questions:
- How to handle the change of NULL constraints?
- Can Temporal Tables be renamed and what happens to the System Versioned table?
- What will happen if you change meta data (data length, data type, ...)?
- What happens if you drop a column or add another column to the Temporal Table?
- what about security for the  system versioned table?
- what about calculated columns in the temporal table?
- ...

You are interested in the answers to all the above questions (and more). This session will answer EVERY question about Temporal Tables.</p>

<h3>Deadlocks. Everything you ever wanted to ask but were too shy. [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It's not a secret that a deadlock - it's not very good. Definition of deadlock is very simple and quite clear: This is an exceptional situation when two concurrent queries request same resources but in a different order. 

Classic deadlock can occur when two concurrent transactions are modifying data from the two tables in a different order. Unfortunately, in real life deadlocks often are more complex and unobvious. One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: "You can not design a database, in which the occurrence of deadlock is impossible". And we should deal with them. The algorithm is simple: 
1. Catch the deadlock
2. Find the root cause
3. Design and implement a solution. 
In practice, these steps can be tricky and may require different types of analysis. 

In this session, we will look at ten various deadlocks scenarios and find the root cause of the deadlocks. Then, you will see how it will be easy to get the solutions for the deadlock issue if we did the secon</p>

<h3>Data Science for beginners [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data science can be hard to grasp, complex and big, but making data science easy to understand and bringing it closer to all who want to tackle this new emerging field is an important task in world of data.  Exploring, extracting and finding hidden gems  from data using statistical and mathematical methods, computer science and several different technologies is essentially what data science is doing. In practice this means, data science is an iterative process of harvesting data, managing and cleaning the data,  performing analysis and and at the end interpreting, visualizing and using information  that will bring insights to end-user, business people and making decisions much easier.
We will focus on answering 5 simple questions. 

1) is this weird? 
2) is A better than B, respectively? 
3) how much / many of this is needed? 
4) this belong to group A? 
5) what is next?

Session we will look into technologies that can be tackled using SQL Server 2016 and ML Azure.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Availability Groups Configuration, Maintenance and Troubleshooting [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Availability Group is a still newest HA feature available in SQL Server, even it’s (highly) available from SQL Server 2012. After you successfully configure and deploy your first AG, you will need to further monitor and maintain AG to ensure that your environment stays highly available after deployment in production. Also, troubleshooting is a part of every DBA’s real life and  we will not even avoid this part. In this session, besides looking on the AG newest features in SQL Server 2016/2017, we will address most common scenarios of administration, monitoring and troubleshooting of Availability Groups.
This session is useful for DBA’s that are using or considering Availability Groups for high availability in SQL Server 2016/2017.</p>

<h3>Adopting Database Lifecycle Management (DLM) at a large Viennese software house [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>At Greentube business is booming. However, for the last few years they have faced increasing problems scaling their product and headcount.

Like many orgs, Greentube has a complicated SQL Server backend which supports many apps.

In 2016, despite best efforts, the database was not in source control, deployments were manual and the production database schemas were out of sync. The core database team was struggling to keep up with the business’s rapid growth because so much time was wasted firefighting unexpected issues.

The business recognised that the database was a bottleneck on the company’s growth. And that was an expensive problem.

Come and learn from Manoj Lona, the DB Team Lead at Greentube, and Alex Yates, a DLM Consultant from DLM Consultants, about how last year they made the necessary technical and organisational changes that today enable GreenTube to deploy their database at the click of a button - allowing them to scale their product and headcount to meet business</p>

<h3>Benchmarking like a Pro [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Exciting times ahead! You bought a license for SQL Server 2016 and you are going to upgrade to the new shiny version of SQL Server on a beefy new machine!
Fantastic! Except that you have no idea how your application will work on the new version. There’s a new cardinality estimator in 2016: how will it affect performance? The new features in In-Memory OLTP and Columnstore Indexes look really promising, but how will your workload take advantage of these features?
The best way to know for sure is to conduct a benchmark and compare it to your current system.
In this demo-intensive session you will discover how to capture a meaningful workload in production and how to replay it against your test system. You will also learn which performance metrics to capture and compare, and which tools can help you in the task.</p>

<h3>Fun with Legal Information in SQL Server: Correlating Offers and Counter-offers [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session you will learn about a typical challenge in legal information management: how to determine whether two (or more) offers to sell, or purchase, products (or services) represent the basis of a legally binding contract.
You will learn which techniques are used to correlate the data in terms of the range of objects, their quantities, their qualitative properties, while also taking into account the temporal properties of the offers.
You will also learn how clustered columnstore indexes can be used to improve the efficiency of the queries needed to solve this important legal problem.</p>

<h3>Industry 4.0 in a box [DE]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>IoT is often associated with developer boards such as the Raspberry PI or Arduino. However, IoT has not only played an important role under the slogan "Industry 4.0", many industry companies are using IoT in their production lines since years.

To show the potential of the Azure IoT in connection with industry components, we have took a conveyor belt, a sorting unit and sensor technologies built-in in a small flightcase. All these industry components are communicating directly to an Azure IoT Hub. 

See how we can analyze the generated data with Stream Analytics and building Power BI dashbaords with streaming data. We will also show how we can interact with the components via cloud 2 device messages if the analysis shows errors or disfunctionalities and how Cortana Analytics can help minimize errors.</p>

<h3>Hacking SQL Server [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How easy is it to hack a SQL Server?
In this session we'll see examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), hacking DDM, RLS, and more. 
More important, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants.
Disclaimer: No actual crimes will be committed. Please do not send agents to my house again.</p>

<h3>SQL Query Performance Monitoring und Analyse [DE]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dieser Vortrag beschäftigt sich anhand konkreter Praxisbeispiele mit dem SQL Query Performance Monitoring und der Analyse mit dem DBPLUS Performance Monitor™.

Der Vortrag gibt Antworten auf die Fragen: Wie identifiziert man schnell unter abertausenden SQL-Abfragen die Wesentlichen hinsichtlich CPU, logischem bzw. physischem IO zu einem spezifischen Zeitpunkt oder über Zeit? Wie lassen sich verändernde Ausführungsplänen auffinden und über Zeit historisch analysieren? Welche Abfragen wurden heute erstmalig ausgeführt bzw. sind für eine Lastspitze zu einer bestimmten Zeit verantwortlich? Welche Abfragen greifen auf eine bestimmte Tabelle zu? Wie kann ich in Sekunden Lastprofile historisch vergleichen und visualisieren? Und wie geht das überhaupt bereits ab SQL Server Version 2005 ohne den Query Store, Instanzweit und Datenbankübergreifend und ohne T-SQL in einer intuitiven grafischen Oberfläche?</p>
