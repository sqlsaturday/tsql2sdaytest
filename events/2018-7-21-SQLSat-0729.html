<h3>SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.</p>

<h3>Introduction To Azure Cosmos DB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Developers are interested in consuming and processing very large amounts of data as quickly as possible. Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB is a NoSQL document database service designed for modern mobile and web applications which require fast reads and writes of unstructured data feeds. Azure Cosmos DB natively supports JSON documents which is a key performance feature. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to create a Cosmos DB instance in Azure, how to work with JSON documents, create Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax, create application logic as stored procedures, triggers and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript. Finally, I will compare performance and feature difference between SQL Server 2016 and Azure Cosmos DB.</p>

<h3>Getting started with Machine Learning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have large amounts of data which you want to leverage to predict the answers to difficult questions?  The seemingly new field of Machine Learning (ML) has been around for almost 60 years, with this exact goal in mind. 

In this session, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of ML, to get you started without requiring a mathematics background.  We will look at how to “frame” your data questions, as well as understanding the type of outputs ML can provide in responding with predictions.   Focus will be placed on the high-level overview of the ML process, and spend time on the simple steps of determining the “right” algorithm to use.  Tools used include Weka and Azure ML Studio, but the focus of the session is on fundamentals and the ML process, not specific toolsets.</p>

<h3>Implementing Row Level Security in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Since the early days of SQL Server, it has been possible to use basic security measures to allow (and disallow) user access to any object in a database, and even limit access to a given column. A more difficult task has been to limit access to the individual rows in a table. This has made application development more complex because whereas most every user may have access to a table like HR.Employee, not every employee will have access to every employee's data. In this session I will cover several techniques to limit access to rows, from methods that have existed since early versions of SQL Server, to the new Row Level Security feature in SQL Server 2016. If time permits, an overview of Dynamic Data Masking will be included, since it is a related technology.</p>

<h3>That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From the Inside</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has a number of metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks, and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from the smallest column up through an entire SQL Server instance and everything in-between. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We'll also demonstrate the new SQL Data Discovery/Classification and Vulnerability Assessment features in SQL Server Management Studio.</p>

<h3>The Data-Professional’s Junk Drawer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is at least one in your home right now, a box, a basket, a bucket, perhaps even actually drawer; hastily organized at best but full of tools, gadgets, widgets and whatchamacallits designed for one or two specific purposes.  Realistically, we all want to use the more generic, multipurposed item found in our “well organized place for storing things”, yet deep down we know that tool/gadget/widget etc. is really what we need.  As data-professionals, we are all familiar with the largest “junk drawer” ever created, the Internet.  In this session, we will discuss some tools which are not data specific, the jobs they do well, and where to find them.  Join as us as explore Robocopy, parts of the SysInterals Suite, a connection manager or two, portables apps aplenty and more so that you can move that file more efficiently, troubleshoot that problem through a different lens, or simply know what the heck someone else is talking about.</p>

<h3>SQL Server ColumnStore Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Come and learn how the SQL Server feature, ColumnStore Indexes, can parallelize your Data Warehouse aggregations. I will be doing a deep dive into the inner workings of ColumnStore indexes; how they work, key characteristics, dos and don'ts, restrictions, and more. I will also have some insight into how CSI's have been updated in SQL Server 2014  beyond.
	If you are a production DBA who needs to find out more about some of the additional hot features that have been included with CSI's, like batch mode processing and data segments, then this session is for you. If you are a BI DBA or developer who needs to find out how CSI's can increase the performance of your aggregations and star-joins by up to 40 times, then this session is also for you.</p>

<h3>5 Minute No Sweat SQL Security Audits</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Security audits such as PCI, STIG, or HIPAA, are important and can be complicated. Depending on the requirements it may take considerable time to gather the information you will need.
In this session, you will get scripts that I use for compliance audits that help to collect the information required for many different audits quickly. Even when you have multiple SQL Servers, you can quickly and easily identify where to focus your efforts to ensure you pass security audits. Through demonstration and discussion of what and why certain items get reviewed you will leave with a better understanding of how to be compliant within you SQL Server environment.</p>

<h3>Code Like a Pirate ... Intro to R and Data Science Tools in MS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is the most popular statistics language used today. It is one of the most useful tools in the data scientist's tool belt. It is also integrated into the MS stack in tools like Azure ML, SQL Server and Power BI and can be used to take your data analytics to the next level.  
  
Come to this session to get an introduction to the R language including: 

  - installing and Configuring R and RStudio 
  - RStudio Overview and Debugging
  - how to Access and Manipulate Data 
  - install and Manage Packages 
  - create and Use Variables 
  - control Flows 
  - functions 
  - basic Graphing and Statistical Analysis. 

We will finish with a brief introductions of how R integrates in Azure ML, Power BI, and SQL Server 2016 using real demos.

<h3>COZYROC: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</p>

<h3>The Anatomy of Select</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.</p>

<h3>How to do a Data Analysis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You log into your email first thing in the morning and the rumors are confirmed; your company is expanding with branch offices in three new cities. As you read, the Big Boss drops by your cubicle and says that she needs an analysis of the real estate situation in all three cities. The analysis needs to include summaries of prices based on factors such as number bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and number of square feet. It should include lots of visualizations, be clear and easy to understand, and point out any interesting relationships that you've uncovered. And you need to have it done by 11:30 a.m.

We'll show you how to do this with real, publically available data from Redfin, using JMP statistical analysis and visualization software. We'll start with concatenation and subsetting, move on to data integrity, then to visualization, exploratory data analysis, and simple linear regression. We'll make plenty of charts and graphs with some summary statistics thrown in for good measure.</p>

<h3>How to screw up Database DevOps in 16 simple steps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps has revolutionised our ability to deliver customer value.

Updates aren’t held up in 6-month release cycles. We’ve automated tests and deployments collaboratively so we know updates work. A virtuous cycle of innovation and testing allows us to build better, more reliable products faster and cheaper.

However, while that’s great in theory, I’ve seen people screw up spectacularly when applying DevOps to relational databases.

In this cheerful session I’ll review the 16 most popular ways to screw up your ability to deliver database updates, resulting in painful, fragile deployments and expensive legacy databases that no-one likes to maintain.

A session for developers *and* DBAs.</p>

<h3>Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.</p>

<h3>Using Kafka for Real-Time Data Ingestion with .NET</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Remember that first time you saw Service Broker and thought of all the great things you could do with it? Remember when you actually tried Service Broker and found all the limitations and pain points? Enter Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system which can scale out to handle millions of messages per second and support a distributed, microservices-oriented architecture. In this talk, we will cover the basics of this powerful system, including general architectural and design principles. We will also build a .NET project which uses Kafka to produce and consume messages quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h3>End to End Encryption and Security in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Protecting our data from unauthorized access becomes more and more important all the time, however it has been difficult to ensure sensitive data is encrypted in SQL Server. The new Always Encrypted feature in SQL Server 2016 makes this much simpler for developers and DBAs with a framework for protecting data from the client, across networks, and inside of the database. This new feature allows for limiting access to the data, even from the DBAs and sysadmins that may control the database instance itself. Learn how to implement and use Always Encrypted in your applications.</p>
