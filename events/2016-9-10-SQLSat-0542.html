<h3>Why “R” you not leveraging the power of “R” in Power BI?!?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

In this session I will focus on the benefits of using R in Power BI. I will show how to leverage R for data munging (ETL) and I will also show how to leverage R to create custom visualizations. I will focus on the quot;Wickham stackquot; which is a group of very popular R packages developed by Hadley Wickham. The “Wickham stack” includes the ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr packages. I will discuss logical use cases for using R within Power BI as well as some of the pitfalls that you may encounter.</p>

<h3>Introduction To Azure DocumentDB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Developers are interested in consuming and processing very large amounts of data as quickly as possible. Microsoft Azure DocumentDB is a NoSQL document database service designed for modern mobile and web applications which require fast reads and writes of unstructured data feeds. Azure DocumentDB natively supports JSON documents which is a key performance feature. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to create a DocumentDB instance in Azure, how to work with JSON documents, create Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax, create application logic as stored procedures, triggers and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript. Finally, I will compare performance and feature difference between SQL Server 2016 and Azure DocumentDB.

<h3>Dammit Jim! Dr McCoy’s Field Guide to system_health (and the default trace)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As DBAs, we are asked all sorts of impossible questions.  Who dropped that important table last month?  Why was everything slow last week?  Who made that user a sysadmin?  You’d have to be a mind reader to know the answers to some of those, right?  Not necessarily!  SQL Server can help you find information about these and other common problems with its default trace and system_health Extended Events session, but you have to know how to collect and interpret the data they provide.  In this session, we’ll explore what system_health and the default trace are, what information they contain, and how to use them to find the answers you’re searching for.</p>

<h3>Extending Your Availability Group for Disaster Recovery</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did you know that SQL Server Availability Groups can be a great solution for disaster recovery?  Availability groups have become well known for their high availability capabilities, and for good reason: they work well, they remove some of clustering’s limitations, and they are fairly straightforward to setup.  Extending an availability group to multiple sites for disaster recovery becomes more complicated.  A lot of moving parts have to come together for it to work properly - SQL Server, Windows, Active Directory, and DNS all get involved in this advanced configuration.  In this session, we’ll discuss some of the factors that complicate a multi-site availability group deployment, and we’ll walk through a multi-site deployment so you can see how it’s done.</p>

<h3>What is Biml and why are SSIS developers excited about it?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is designed for you, the experienced SSIS developer who's been hearing about the Business Intelligence Markup Language, Biml, but has not taken the plunge. We will cover what the Biml language is and how using your familiar development tools, SQL Server Data Tools, SSDT, and BIDS Helper, you will be able to streamline the creation of SSIS packages.

We will work through progressively more complex examples from a "Hello World" equivalent to a to a full fledged, audited, truncate and reload pattern based on an external metadata repository. 

You will leave this session armed with the knowledge of how Biml can help you achieve a consistent and reproducible approach for the creation of SSIS solutions.

<h3>Availability Groups:  Monitoring and Alerting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you have your availability groups configured and everything reports green.  How do you measure SLA compliance? Do you know when replication is delayed? Did you know it failed over last night?
This session will answer all these questions and more, and will show you what should you be looking at to ensure no surprises...
We will look at the DMVs, extended event sessions, perfmon counters, SQL agent jobs and policies to show what to monitor in your AG and how to setup alerts so you know when to take action.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Ensemble Modeling</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data vault is a compelling architecture for an enterprise data warehouse using SQL Server. We will review the basics about enterprise data warehouse design, introduce you to the data vault architecture and discuss how you can leverage BI features of SQL Server to help make your data warehouse solution provide maximum value to your users. We will walk through example data models to help highlight why data vault architecture facilitates traceability, auditability and scalability. Additionally we will cover implementation advantages which can facilitate agile development, strategies to load massive amounts of data in parallel, how to transition the data warehouse to a system of record, how to easily automate loading using BIML because of strictly naming rules and conventions, and finally how to support the Master Data Management needs of the organization. </p>

<h3>Using Powershell to Document SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more

<h3>Stop making ugly Power BI Reports!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI is simple to use and it#39;s easy to crank out reports. Before you know it, you have a dozen reports that are somewhat confusing and not quite as appealing as you planned. In this demo heavy session, we will take a fairly typical Power BI report and give it a makeover. We will discuss layout strategy, color palette, and tricks such as slicer orientation, tooltips, visual interactions, use of shapes, and some DAX magic to bring clarity to the data we are trying to convey.</p>
