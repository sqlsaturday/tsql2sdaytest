<h3>Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve been using SQL Trace and Profiler since you started using SQL Server.  They’re like old friends, tried and true.  You know how they work, you know what you can capture, you know how to find the data you need.  But now you’ve been told that your good friends have been deprecated in SQL Server 2012, and you need to become best friends with Extended Events.  What is THAT all about?  It’s ok.  Really.  In this session we’ll look at Profiler and Extended Events side by side to see how easy it is to transition to Extended Events.  We’ll step through real world examples using Extended Events to do what you’re used to doing with Trace, and even more.  You can find the time learn Extended Events…today.</p>

<h3>Reporting in Production: A Hadoop Case Study</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've upgraded to better hardware, tuned your queries, and busy seasons is still six months away; you should be resting easy. But reports are running too long, SQL Server is under a heavy load, and you're not sure how you'll keep up with the demands of customers, much less the rest of the business. I've been there before. By moving functionality into Hadoop, I've been able to scale the database bigger and faster than previously possible; small incremental improvements became massive linear improvements and I delivered functionality that was previously thought to be impractical. In this session, I'll cover patterns, strategies, and use cases to increase reporting and analytics performance using Hadoop.</p>

<h3>What's In YOUR DB Wallet?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When you have one SQL Server instance to maintain, you can give that instance plenty of TLC.  When you have a hundred instances, many things which worked before simply will not scale, potentially leaving your databases in peril.  The next step (after justifiable panic) is to give yourself a force multiplier to help you keep your sanity on the job--specifically, an administrative database.  This session will give you an idea of what kinds of tools should go into an administrative database, as well as how to use this to collect important metrics for reporting and auditing.  Audience participation from more advanced database administrators is encouraged:  we want to find out what's in YOUR DB wallet.</p>

<h3>Creating an SSIS template using BIML</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When creating an SSIS package, it is best practice to follow some kind of template.  The package configuration needs to be set up.  Logging needs to be set up.  The work that you do to set up this template is tedious at best.

In this session we will develop a template SSIS package using BIML.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.

We will create a package that has some specific connection strings.  We will tie those connection strings to configuration settings.  Then we will add custom logging.  We will then build individual SSIS packages to copy a list of tables to their destination.

<h3>Design and Implement BI like Edison! </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor.  In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.</p>

<h3>Demystifying Database Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database statistics are not made up numbers, like the statistics you may hear on TV or read in a news article. They are critical metadata used by SQL Server’s query optimizer. In this session, we will look at statistics from the ground up and remove the mystery that surrounds them. Demos and real-world examples will be used to explain what statistics are, why you should care about them, and what you can control. By the end of the session, you will understand:  • How to view statistics and interpret the histogram  • How and when to update statistics  • How statistics affect the query optimizer  • When you can let SQL Server manage statistics, and when you need to step in </p>

<h3>Possible Musics:  Choosing between Analysis Services 2012 Multidimensional and Tabular</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models, developed by business users, to a dedicated server.  Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths.  In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features.  He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.</p>

<h3>Gather SQL Server Performance Data with PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We all know how important it is to keep a baseline of performance metrics that allow us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  We don't always know how to do this easily and consistently.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.</p>

<h3>PowerShell 101 for the SQL Server DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The more you have to manage, the more likely you'll want to automate your processes. PowerShell is the scripting language that will make you truly effective at managing lots of servers. This session will introduce you to PowerShell and show you how to use it to manage SQL Server across many instances.</p>

<h3>Looney Tuner?  No, there IS a method to my madness</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL diagramming techniques. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing. If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.</p>

<h3>SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.</p>

<h3>Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.

<h3>Much Ado About Hadoop</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>By now you've probably heard the words "Big Data" and "Hadoop", but you're not sure what they mean, much less how to get started. Maybe you're struggling with storing a lot of data, rapidly processing a huge volume of data, or maybe you're just curious. There are a bewildering array of options and use cases within the Hadoop ecosystem. Every day I help customers understand their data problems, understand where Hadoop fits into their environment, and determine how they can use Hadoop to solve their problem. This session provides an introduction to what Hadoop is, when it's appropriate to use Hadoop, and guidance on how to get started. </p>

<h3>Full-Text Search in SQL 2012 with Custom Proximity</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Custom proximity search is a new feature introduced in SQL Server 2012 Full-Text Search. It's facilitated using the NEAR operator, allowing it to be used in the CONTAINS predicate or CONTAINSTABLE function. The NEAR operator allows for searching words near each other. It also allows the user to specify the maximum number of non-search terms separating the first and last search terms in a match. In addition, an optional parameter can be used to specify an exact order match.</p>

<h3>SQL Audit - auditing doesn't have to be boring</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let's face it, auditing isn't fun.  But if you're a DBA, you need to know what's going on in your SQL Server instance.  Fortunately, SQL Audit makes it easy.  In this session, we'll cover what you can and can't audit using SQL Audit, enhancements in 2012, configuring database and server audits, ways to process output, and ideas for how to implement SQL Audit on a larger scale.  Auditing doesn't have to be hard.  And with the help of a little custom coding, it can even be fun.  </p>
