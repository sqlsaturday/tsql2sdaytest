<h3>Intro to SQL Operations Studio</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>"SQL Operations Studio (preview) offers a modern, keyboard-focused T-SQL coding experience that makes your everyday tasks easier with built-in features, such as multiple tab windows, a rich T-SQL editor, IntelliSense, keyword completion, code snippets, code navigation, and source control integration (Git). Run on-demand T-SQL queries, view and save results as text, JSON, or Excel. Edit data, organize your favorite database connections, and browse database objects in a familiar object browsing experience."

And, it runs on a Mac (and Linux, and Windows, too). Similar to Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio (still in pre-release form) lets you connect to and manipulate your databases without spinning up Visual Studio (or SSMS). We'll walk through how to get the bits and install them, then connect to and query a database (in Azure) - we might not even use a mouse! If time permits, we'll take a look at Code Snippets - a built-in capability to make your T-SQL coding super-productive!</p>

<h3>Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.</p>

<h3>Targeting Wait Statistics with Extended Events and DMVs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views new to SQL Server 2016 for examining wait statistics at a query level, rather than at the server level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.</p>

<h3>Reducing The Surface Area Of Risk in Data Security</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data obfuscation, also known as data masking, is soon a new legal requirement. Masking is the solution for non-production systems (i.e. DEV, TEST, etc) to greatly reduce the surface area of risk for data breach in your organization.  Masking should not be confused with encryption, which is an appropriate solution for production applications.  Those who believe that encryption solves all security problems are misled.

When done properly, masked data is not noticeable unless you look closely. Masking data well might still be usable for analytic reporting and aggregation, yet utterly useless for revealing confidential data. Masking is important enough that sophisticated software packages have become available.

Come learn about the right way to mask non-production data in order to allow the organization to limit possible exposure only to production.  Learn what techniques can be used, why, and what factors should be considered when deciding to secure confidential data.</p>

<h3>Stop Doing That! Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code but do not scale inside SQL Server. Things like Scalar-Value functions, Unions, CTEs, and row by row processing can make for more work than you would expect.

In this session, we will focus on several anti-patterns like these and show how to rework them to improve scale in the database engine. 

By the end of the session, you will be able to quickly identify these common anti-patterns and analyze their sometimes unclear cost to the engine. Heading back to the office, you’ll be able to identify pain points in your longest running queries from a T-SQL perspective and become a code tuning rock star!</p>

<h3>Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.</p>

<h3>PowerShell for BI Professionals: Automating SSIS, SSRS  SSAS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowerShell has allowed DBAs to manage huge numbers of SQL servers, all automatically. Now BI practitioners can reap the same benefits of scale and automation.  Scenarios that are normally extremely time consuming can be done quickly, all with a few lines of PowerShell.  

This session will be filled with demos based on real-life scenarios and use-cases.  We will demonstrate how to scale and automate your BI solutions, with a minimum of effort.  In particular, we will be covering PowerShell cmdlets  their integrations with SSRS, SSIS,  SSAS.

By the end of the session, you'll be able to accomplish in minutes what would normally take hours or days.  You’ll know ways to quickly deploy hundreds of SSRS objects to multiple servers; or instantly identify and process stale SSAS dimensions.  Additionally, you will also be able to take care of some pesky ETL tasks, some by automating SSIS, and others using just plain old PowerShell.</p>

<h3>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</p>

<h3>Migrate multi-terabyte DB from OnPrem to Azure SQL (ASD) with minimal downtime.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With Azure PaaS database offering gaining more popularity due to its ultimate flexibility and minimized support overhead, more companies are considering it as superior alternative not just to on-site, but also to IaaS hosting options.
Migrating an existing database from on-prem SQL may prove to be a challenging effort for applications with critical availability requirements and large size databases.
The default migration method offered by Microsoft uses the Data Migration Assistant (DMA). Designed with simplicity in mind, DMA migration is an offline operation.  Migrating a database with the maximal Azure SQL supported size (4TB) using DMA will require hours and hours of downtime.
With transaction log replay operations not supported in Azure SQL, transactional replication remains as our only option for transitioning large databases into Azure SQL and avoiding long downtime. In this presentation we will demonstrate how to migrate a database to ASD using SQL Server replication technology.</p>

<h3>HiHo! HiHo! SQL Server on Linux, We Go!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server has been running on Windows for years. Now Microsoft is making it available on Linux in order to provide a consistent database platform across Window and Linux servers, as well as on-premises and in the cloud. In this presentation, Janis Griffin, database performance evangelist at SolarWinds, will discuss the advantages of using SQL Server on Linux, comparing architecture, cost and performance. Several demonstrations on installing and maintaining SQL Server on Linux will be shown along with an introduction of several useful Linux commands.

The participant will learn:
1. The advantages of using SQL Server on Linux, comparing architecture, cost and performance to Window servers.
2. How to install, maintain and backup SQL Server on Ubuntu Linux systems 
3. Several useful Linux commands to monitor/manage SQL Server</p>

<h3>Biml for Beginners: Script and Automate SSIS Development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you tired of creating and updating the same SSIS packages again and again? Is your wrist hurting from all that clicking, dragging, dropping, connecting and aligning? Do you want to take the next step and really speed up your SSIS development?

Say goodbye to repetitive work and hello to Biml, the markup language for Business Intelligence projects.

In this session we will look at the basics of Biml. First learn how to use Biml to generate SSIS packages from database metadata. Then see how you can reuse code to implement changes in multiple SSIS packages and projects with just a few clicks. Finally, we will create an example project that you can download and start with to speed up your SSIS development from day one.

Stop wasting your valuable time on doing the same things over and over and over again, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!</p>

<h3>Collecting Performance Metrics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why a server is running slowly? Or whether or not a server can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? How would you share this information with your manager? The answer is baseline metrics.

Only if you have baseline performance information can you answer these questions and form a plan to address the issues at hand. In this session, we will be discussing several open source tools you can combine into an inexpensive baselining system you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions.

Attendees in this session will learn how to collect important metric data, what data to collect, and how to interpret that data and develop a plan of action to address any issues.</p>

<h3>Relational Data Architecture 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.</p>

<h3>Understanding and Handling Database Corruption</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption. In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands such as DBINFO, CHECKDB and PAGE. You'll learn how to monitor for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when it's time to restore instead of repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for issues such as page corruption or data purity problems, and take the appropriate measures to deal with them.</p>

<h3>ORMs and the DBA: How to Make Both Happy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Talk to any DBA about ORMs and you'll quickly find out all the things you like about ORMs are what DBAs don't like. Interestingly enough, most developers I've talked to have issues with their ORMs, too. In this session, we'll explore why ORMs cause such trouble, some strategies for mitigating those troubles, and I'll introduce some tools (and even yet another ORM) that help solve some of the worst of the problems we see in the database when using ORMs.</p>

<h3>Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.</p>

<h3>Level Up Your Cloud Infrastructure Skills</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Think infrastructure in the cloud is still just for sysadmins? Think again! As your organization moves into the cloud, infrastructure skills are more important than ever for DBAs to master. Expert knowledge of cloud-related infrastructure will help you maintain performance and availability for databases in the cloud. For example, know what an IOP is? How many does your database consume during a given day? Properly sizing a cloud database depends on your knowledge of this metric. Failure to properly configure storage performance at the time of deployment will slow down your SQL Server considerably. Come learn many of the key cloud infrastructure points that you should master as the DBA role continues to evolve!</p>

<h3>Infrastructure 101 for SQL Server Deployments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In a cloudy, virtualized world where we have less physical deployments of SQL Server, those responsible for SQL Server still need to understand basic infrastructure concepts whether you are deploying on Windows Server or Linux. Without them, your VMs and IaaS deployments will not scale, will underperform, and most likely will have poor availability. This session will cover the basics of what you need to know whether you are deploying SQL Server on premises or in the public cloud to go from SQL Server zero to SQL Server hero and be able to have better working relationships with the other administrators in your organization.</p>

<h3>How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.</p>

<h3>A DBA's guide to whole stack performance troubleshooting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.</p>

<h3>Decoding the Cardinality Estimator to Speed Up Queries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The cardinality estimator in SQL Server is a massively complex piece of software that is responsible for calculating the estimated number of rows for query plans. We will derive some of the simplest and most important rules for cardinality estimation. Armed with that knowledge, we will address errors in cardinality estimates which can cause poor query performance. Demos include filtering on multiple columns, using local variables, dealing with ascending keys, and more.</p>

<h3>Why Third Party Vendors Do The Things They Do</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever installed a third-party application that uses SQL Server, started to use it, and then wondered why does this feature behave this way or what the heck were they thinking when they did it this way.

I at one point was one of those people who designed, developed, and maintained databases for an ISV.  This is my chance to explain and atone for my database sins and explain why some decisions seem like good ideas at the time and why some are forced upon an ISV.

This presentation has three main objectives:
 1) Explain why vendors make the design, coding, and implementation decisions that they do; 
2) Discuss how to make third-party applications run better in your environment; 
3) Teach you how to work around those limitations and work with those vendors and get better support.</p>

<h3>Disaster Recovery Planning for Your Career and Your Life...There's No Certification For This</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As DBAs, disaster recovery planning is one of the first things we learn. We have it planned and can execute it on a dime. But do you have a plan for when things go wrong in your life outside of databases? Some speakers might use the words resiliency and grit but those words aren't a concrete plan.  Add in the fact that IT personnel have to constantly adapt and learn to keep their career current.  So what do you, as a IT worker, need to do daily, weekly or monthly to build a life that can withstand or rebound from adversity? The presentation will focus on the career, financial and emotional supports that propel you during the best of times and help you survive layoffs, financial downturns or personal tragedies.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS without Programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. 

The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort.

Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at runtime without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at runtime.

Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</p>

<h3>Plan Cache performance tuning and pruning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we'll discuss ways to manage execution plans inside the plan cache of busy and unpredictable SQL Servers. The plan cache keeps SQL Server healthy, but all it takes is one bad execution plan to decrease server performance.

Just like gardening, keeping a database healthy requires pruning.  Techniques to manage, remove, and improve execution plans will be shown. The Query Store gives us power tools for this work, but it's not the entire solution.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slow? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2016 Integration Services (SSIS 2016) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.</p>

<h3>How to Build Fast Multi-Parameter Stored Procedures</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You're comfortable writing T-SQL, and you've built a lot of stored procedures that have a bunch of parameters. For example, you have that "product search" stored proc with parameters for product category, name, price range, sort order, etc, and you have to accept any of 'em. 

So how do we make those go fast? And how can we get 'em to use indexes?

There is more to being a software engineer than just writing code. I believe it is important to display a sense of craftsmanship in every line written. Agile process, test-driven development, and design patterns are effective tools to that end. More importantly than simply writing code that works within design parameters and calling the job finished, good code should be self-documenting, testable, and as concise as possible without sacrificing readability.</p>
