<h3>Getting the Skinny on Minimally Logged Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Any changes to Non-Memory Optimized tables require a certain amount of logging to the transaction log in order to ensure the integrity of the operation and of course the database. Most of these are fully logged operations and can write a tremendous amount of data to the transaction log. As you probably already know these can lead to various performance and availability issues. However you may be able to minimize the effect of these with what is called a minimally logged operation. This session will outline how these can be used under the right conditions to save time, resources and potentially a lot of headaches. Various demos will hit home on just how much of an impact this can have on some every day operations.</p>

<h3>What can SQLCLR do for you?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most articles and blog entries regarding SQLCLR are focused on how to write functions or stored procedures, but very little time is spent on showing what SQLCLR does really well and where it can be truly beneficial. Here we will explore the what / why / when of using SQLCLR to accomplish things that cannot be done in T-SQL, such as: Dynamic SQL, error handling, and calling Stored Procedures within functions; capturing PRINT output; Custom Aggregates; multi-threading; and more. We will look at practical examples of using SQLCLR to reduce code complexity, reduce the time it takes to complete a project, increase performance, and assist in automation (i.e. stay within T-SQL instead of using SSIS or xp_cmdshell).</p>

<h3>Working with Object Compression in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 introduced object compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What you might not know boils down to some subtleties of compression. Forexample, not all page compressed objects are entirely page compressed. Many pages can be uncompressed or just row-compressed. 

This session shows you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session also shows how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. You can use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</p>

<h3>Advanced Scripting Using SSIS Script Tasks and Components</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS has many great built-in tasks and components. Sometime, though, you need to go further than what they allow. Come to this session to see how far you can stretch the scripting capabilities of SSIS. 
SSIS offers significant capabilities out-of-the-box. However, many data movement projects have needs that go above and beyond the common scenarios. Have you ever needed to calculate running totals during your ETL process? What about using dynamically updated business rules during processing to determine what data is valid? These things, and much more, can be accomplished using the script task and component within SSIS. During this session, we will demonstrate several scripts in SSIS (including the ones mentioned above) that show how to take full advantage of the capabilities of SSIS. This session is intended for people who have worked with and understand SSIS, and have a basic understanding of .NET development.</p>

<h3>A Masters Passport to Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

<h3>Table Vars and Temp Tables – What you NEED to Know!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represents temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</p>

<h3>Getting Started with SSIS Script Tasks and Components</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS has many great built-in tasks and components. Sometime, though, you need to go further than what they allow. Come to this session for an introduction to the scripting capabilities of SSIS. 
Many data movement activities can be handled with SSIS using the built-in tasks and components. Eventually, though, you will run into a scenario that will be better handled by extending SSIS functionality with custom code. In this session, we will cover the basics of using scripts in SSIS control flows and data flows. We’ll talk about the pros and cons of scripts, review the development environment for scripts, cover some interesting and useful .NET classes, and walk through multiple examples of scripts that add useful functionality to SSIS.</p>

<h3>Analysis Services: Show Me Where It Hurts</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>"Its.Slow!" are probably the two most dreaded words for any database professional (right behind "You're fired!") 

What's slow? Since when? Compared to what?

Join this "something-everyone-should-be-doing-but-isn't" session, in which we will discuss baselines and performance monitoring for your SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) environment. We'll cover what a baseline is, what information it needs to include, and how it can help you troubleshoot immediate problems and proactively avoid them in the future. Walk away from the session with a plan that you can implemented next week to help avoid being caught off guard by SSAS performance issues and to make troubleshooting a breeze.</p>

<h3>R For The .NET Developer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we will look at R.  Besides being a pirate’s favorite language (ARRRRRR), R is the most popular language in the world for analytics and data science.  Recently Microsoft purchases Revolution Analytics and has announced that R will be supported in Sql Server 2016.
This session will assume no prior experience with R.  We will look at its syntax and how it compares to Tsql/C#/VB.NET, we will do some basic data science with R, and we talk about some of the hard-learned lessons about using R in your production environment.

<h3>Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline w/PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.</p>

<h3>Collecting and Analyzing File  Wait Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is your SQL Server instance running at its peak performance level?  Probably not but the real question is do you know why not? Is your disk subsystem too slow or are you lacking enough CPU’s or is it something else? It is very easy to capture and analyze the file  wait statistical information that is automatically provided by the SQL Server instance with several key DMV’s so why not utilize them. We will see how you can stop chasing your tail and focus on which area of SQL Server performance bottlenecks are doing you the most harm. This should be part of every DBA’s arsenal so come make it part of yours as well.</p>

<h3>20 Minute Tabular Model</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Tabular model is still the new kid on the block in the world of SQL Server Analysis Services, and its importance in the Microsoft BI roadmap continues to grow. Based on xVelocity, a highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models promise considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. 

Join me in this session and learn what a Tabular model is, how it fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live step-by-step demo where we'll build and deploy a basic Tabular model. </p>

<h3>Common SQL Server Development Misconceptions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server has been around long enough for numerous misconceptions to have become part of the general folklore.  Despite the best efforts of many,  aspiring SQL development professionals still regularly find themselves misinformed about the behaviors of key features such as cursors,  temporary tables and table variables, nested  transactions and foreign keys. Early in your career you may already be instilling a lifetime of bad habits that can be detrimental to the performance and the integrity of the applications you work with. In this session we address several such commonly held misconceptions and demonstrate that they are invalid.</p>
