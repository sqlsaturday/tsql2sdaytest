<h3>Relational databases vs Non-relational databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion about the place and purpose of the many recent non-relational database solutions (“NoSQL databases”) compared to the relational database solutions that have been around for so many years.  In this presentation I will first clarify what exactly these database solutions are, how they compare to Hadoop, and discuss the best use cases for each.  I’ll discuss topics involving ACID vs BASE, scaling, data warehousing, polyglot persistence, CAP theorem, and SQL Server 2016 and PolyBase.  We will even touch on a new type of database solution called NewSQL.  If you are building a new solution it is important to understand all your options so you take the right path to success.</p>

<h3>Tips that have saved my bacon</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, I propose to share some of the tricks I've used on the operational side of being a DBA.

There's saying, never perform small miracles, people to rely on them, but isn't it useful to have a few in your back-pocket. 

Everyone knows log-shipping is great for DR recovery, but what about using it for minor issues, like a delete or update gone bad? Want to move a large table someplace else (like that "oh it'll just be a small audit table, it won't grow large because we'll write the functionality later to keep it small" and they never do? UNC backups... an often overlooked but useful option for making a backup AND getting it off your server. Run a small operation where too many fingers have access to the operational DB and you want to catch them? These are some of the tricks I've picked up over the years and used more than once to perform small miracles and have saved my bacon or the bacon of others</p>

<h3>Choosing the right technologies for a big data solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Has your company been building data warehouses for years using SQL Server?  And are you now tasked with creating or moving your data warehouse to the cloud and modernizing it to support “Big Data”?  What technologies/tools should use?  That is what this presentation will help you answer.  First we will cover what questions to ask concerning data (type, size, frequency), reporting, performance needs, on-prem vs cloud, staff technology skills, OSS requirements, and cost.  Then we will show you common big data architecture solutions and help you to answer questions such as: What tool do I use to move data to the cloud?  Where do I store the data?  Should I use a data lake?  Do I still need a cube?  What about Hadoop/NoSQL?  Do I need the power of MPP?  Should I build a "logical data warehouse"?  Finally, we’ll show some architectures of real-world customer big data solutions.  Come to this session to get started down the path to making the proper technology choices in moving to the cloud.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Reporting Services 2016 on Steroids!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.</p>

<h3>Azure SQL Database Vs. Amazon RDS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>They are the largest hosting companies in the world, Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, both have our beloved SQL Server running as a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service). 

The term DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service) is a brand new concept that brings the self-managing cloud process to our reality, now administrative tasks and process such as backup, high availability and disaster recovery solutions will be handed to the hosting company.

Flexibility, scalability on-demand, and rapid provisioning are the hottest points to move towards to the PaaS delivery.
Ready to change the mindset of your company and concern only with the business value, join with me on this session and open your mind to the new reality.</p>

<h3>Outsourcing database administration to your users.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How outsource administrative tasks to your end user groups in a safe, secure, and repeatable pattern.   Now you no longer have to pause and stop what you are doing to create that new login, and replicate it to your Disaster Recovery.   You do not have to stop and perform a backup/restore to refresh the development environment.  Empower your end users, let them do this on their own without compromising your security.

There will be a demo!</p>

<h3>Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Being able to group data into logical and meaningful sets can be extremely useful.  When the data involved is a non-repeating sequence of integers, grouping is not too difficult.  Most real data, though, is made up of dates, times, decimals, and rarely can guarantee non-repeating, non-null data sets.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data.  Want to know how many production incidents make up a single common problem?  Can we track sales success by the number of  consecutive weeks that an agent has exceeded their goal?  How about the longest home run streak hit by Derek Jeter at night games on Tuesdays?

Discussion will include performance, CTEs, recursion, set-based vs. iterative analysis, and some pretty hairy TSQL!</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2016: A dive into Data Quality Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016: Data quality and data cleansing have always been major challenges to any enterprise that deals with data. For those of us who have dealt with Data Profiler Tasks in SQL Server 2008, we were shocked yet pleasantly surprised with the great advances that Microsoft has made with the advent of Data Quality Services, in the SQL Server 2012 release. In this hands-on presentation we shall be looking at how to set up a new knowledge base, based upon an existing one, set up rules, do knowledge discovery within the new knowledge base and finally cleanse the data through a data quality project. The end results being more effective data, guaranteed to keep end users and management happy.</p>

<h3>Wish you could live the glamorous consulting life?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We are going to talk about a topic many will not touch at a SQL Saturday: Money. How to make it, how to get customers, how to market. Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).

I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
In this session you will learn sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life. An essential session for those thinking about this choice and/or those who are just starting out. Y</p>

<h3>Extending DevOps To SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.</p>

<h3>Building Secure Applications in Azure SQL Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cloud computing requires new security paradigms that are unfamiliar to many application users, database administrators, and programmers. Consequently, some organizations are hesitant to implement a cloud infrastructure for data management due to perceived security risks. However, much of this concern can be alleviated through a better understanding of the security features built into Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

Azure provides extremely robust security protection at the physical, logical, and data layers of its services and applications, making Azure datacenters among the most secure facilities of their kind in the world. Likewise, Azure SQL Database includes multiple layers of security, with role-based logical data protection and auditing to monitor the security of your data.</p>

<h3>Network your Way to Success!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did you know that most employers  -- whether looking for a full time employee, contractor, or consultant – interview people because of their technical skills and experiences, but hire and keep them for their social capital?  In times of economic downturn, it’s not the person who is the most competent who stays; it’s the one who’s most competent, likeable, and connected.   Socially adept people also get invited to the table more often for big projects and are promoted (or extended) more frequently than purely ‘competent’ individuals. 

Whether or not you’ve been in your role for a few months, years, or even decades – or you’re looking for a new job and new opportunities -- strategic networking is the way to make yourself more relevant, more attractive for projects and promotion – or more hirable by potential customers.  

Join us for an interactive session to strategize the best actions to increase your social capital and network your way to success!</p>

<h3>SQL Server Infrastructure – Cloud and On-Prem Options</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Years ago, DBAs worked side-by-side with the infrastructure teams who managed the equipment their databases ran on. Today, organizations are more siloed than ever, and DBAs have less visibility into this layer than ever before. What is actually under the OS? Why does it matter? 

Physical servers, enterprise virtualization, and cloud servers all provide solid platforms for you to run your databases on, but improperly configured and tuned platforms can lead to performance nightmares. Let’s explore the various layers, options, and performance characteristics of the different systems underneath SQL Server so you can improve the performance of your systems.</p>

<h3>Stop Doing That! 5 Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code but do not scale  inside SQL Server. Things like Scalar-Value functions, Unions, CTEs, and row by row processing can make for more work then you would expect.

In this session, we will focus on several anti-patterns like these and show how to rework them to improve scale in the database engine.   

By the end of the session, you will be able to quickly identify these common anti-patterns and analyze their sometimes unclear cost to the engine. Heading back to the office, you’ll be able to identify pain points in your longest running queries from a T-SQL perspective and become a code tuning rockstar!</p>

<h3>SQL Server High Availability in Azure IaaS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Deploying mission critical SQL Server in Azure IaaS requires an in-depth understanding of storage, virtual networks, load balancers, SQL Server AlwaysOn and more. To qualify for Azure’s SLA of 99.95% availability, steps must be taken to mitigate downtime by leveraging Fault Domains and Update Domains in conjunction with traditional HA options.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) replaces Azure “Classic” as the preferred deployment method in Azure. New features such as Deployment Templates and Resource Groups introduced in ARM make it a powerful tool in managing the entire life-cycle of SQL Server in Azure.

In this session attendees will learn how to leverage ARM to deploy SQL AlwaysOn Availability Groups and Failover Cluster Instances. Template Deployments and manual configurations using the Azure Portal and Azure PowerShell will be demonstrated.</p>

<h3>Accelerating DevOps and TDM Using Data Virtualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is the merger of app development, testing, and IT ops.  All tasks from coding to testing to operations should be automated so new features and fixes can be continuously quickly.

Test Data Management (TDM) is the optimization of the process of software quality, ensuring that applications properly work according to their specifications.

Constraining both DevOps and TDM is database size. "Storage is cheap" is not merely a lie, but more to the point it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around from place to place, and time itself is expensive and dear.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.</p>

<h3>No inside, No outside, No box. DellEMC software defined storage s</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Enjoy lunch while learning about the next evolution of storage technologies!
 
In the past, islands of servers with local unevenly utilized and difficult to protect resources led to virtualization technologies like storage arrays (i.e. SAN's) to enable larger pooling of resources and advanced strategies in data protection and high availability.  While media technologies like SSD's have evolved from the rotational disk of the past, so has the array evolved into software defined storage strategies leveraging commodity hardware and providing almost limitless scale, face melting performance and new targets in availability.  Come learn how the storage market leader DellEMC views software defined storage and how it's product ScaleIO can help you evolve.</p>

<h3>R-ternatives in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

There are 3 ways you can leverage R in Power BI. You can use it as a data source, you can leverage it in Power Query, or you can use it to create custom visualizations. In this session I present easy to follow examples of those 3 scenarios. I will also provide resources that will enable you to take what you learned to the next level.</p>
