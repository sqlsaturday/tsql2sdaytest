<h3>Hacking SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), hacking DDM, and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants.
Disclaimer: No actual crimes will be committed. Please do not send agents to my house again.</p>

<h3>Always On Multi-Site Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Building robust and resilient Data Platform solutions can be complex and costly, building out for both High Availability and Disaster Recovery. The Always On technologies incorporated in the Microsoft SQL Server stack help Data Platform Engineers to do just this. Creating solutions that span multiple locations, in an effort to protect the data that we are tasked to manage on a daily basis.

Together we will walk through the architecture patterns, technology requirements, and configuration options that you need to know in order to build a solid Data Platform. Understanding the implementation differences between on-premises and cloud based deployments is important. Especially as there are specific requirements that need to be met for up-time SLAs to be applicable, as well as mitigating for region failures.

All of these elements mean that it is more than just simple wizards to follow in order to have a solid, reliable, and robust SQL Server Data Platform.</p>

<h3>Automate your SSIS deployment process</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Deploying SSIS projects is a daunting manual task we do every time in SQL Server Data Tools. Rebuild/Deploy/Validate/Execute. Add version control to it, branch, merge, add packages to projects, switch between DEV/TEST/PROD environments - it's getting even more boring.

On this session I will show you how to put all that tasks to the server side. You'll see how to use Powershell and API available in .NET. Or MSBuild. I will add a bit of TFS to it to automate all things and you'll see that testing and deployment of subsequent project versions doesn't have to be so bothersome.

You will see what to look at when designing your own solution, what resources to use, what limitations await and how to overcome them.</p>

<h3>Database version control and deployment: model or migration scripts?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For the last few years Microsoft have been promoting declarative, model-based database development with tools like SSDT. For many this is the way forward – gone are the days of managing endless upgrade scripts and manual deployments. 

At the same time, leaders and shakers of our industry including Jez Humble, Pramod Sadalge and Paul Stovell promote an iterative, migration script driven approach asserting that deployment scripts should be tested early and not generated by a tool. 

I'm irritated whenever I go to a “how to do database continuous delivery” session and the speaker presents one way as good and the other as bad. Like most things, it depends.

I’ll illustrate the limitations of each approach with a simple scenario. I’ll describe which projects are better suited to a model or a migrations approach, and whether it’s possible to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<h3>Management Studio level-up</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Move up to Management Studio Superstar with these great productivity tips! We’ll explore stuff like keyboard shortcuts, configuration options, how to keep your SSMS settings synchronized across multiple environments and other really useful everyday tricks and hacks. Think “hey, wait, how’d you do that!?”

Some of the things I’ll cover:

* Previewing and quick-reference stuff you can do with keyboard shortcuts
* Quickly navigating your code to find errors or bookmarks

No undocumented stuff, no registry editor, and nothing you wouldn’t put into production. Just really clever productivity tips that will take some of the burden off your everyday work.

But I’m not going to sugarcoat it. Your code may still run slow, and you’ll probably write just as many bugs – but you’ll write them a lot quicker and with so much more style and panache.</p>

<h3>Power BI behind the scene: security and user management</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI is a great suite of tools for business analytics and reporting. You use it to create reports and dashboard to deliver insights throughout your company. 
But, what about the new licensing model recently introduced for Power BI? How it can fits to your needs?
Every organization is a complex system with rules and limitations. Users belong to groups each with visibility profile. 
So you need to know how security in Power BI works: how to configure and restrict access, how to filter data based on the logged user, how to implement static and dynamic Row-level security (RLS), how to control usage of specific features. 

Furthermore you deal with a large number of users you can’t leverage by hand. Power BI provides an admin portal that allows you to manage users and groups in the Office 365 admin center. 
Come to this session to discover what’s behind the scenes in Power BI and how to implement a solution compliant to your security and governance model.</p>

<h3>Boosting SSAS productivity with Tabular Editor</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Authoring SSAS tabular models using the standard tools (SSDT) can be a pain when working with large models. This is because SSDT keeps a connection open to a live workspace database, which needs to be synchronized with changes in the UI. This makes the developer experience slow and buggy at times. Tabular Editor is an open-source alternative, that relies only on the Model.bim metadata and the Tabular Object Model (TOM). Compared to SSDT, making changes to measures, calculated columns, display folders, etc. is lightning fast, and the UI provides a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" experience, making it much easier to manage and author large models. Combined with scripting functionality, a Best Practice Analyzer, command-line build and deployment, and much more, Tabular Editor is a must for every SSAS Tabular developer. This PowerPoint-free session will focus on demoing the capabilities of the tool.</p>

<h3>Delivering BI Continuously</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is tightly coupled to Visual Studio Online (VSO) as the central component to orchestrate the path to an automated deployment process. The tool itself is so much more than just a code repository, and once we have unlocked the power of VSO, you will quickly realize the sky is the limit. Focus in this session will mainly be delivered on processes around SSAS, SSIS and SSRS and we will also briefly touch on Continuous Delivery for the underlying Data Warehouse. Come join this session, if you are ready to take the first few steps towards automation of your deployment processes and want to know how Microsoft tools can help you. 
 
In detail we will be looking at these components:
Visual Studio Online
3rd. Party Add-Ons

<h3>From SSAS to Azure Analysis Services - Lessons learned</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Seeing a potential in jumping on board the latest and greatest we decided to start using Azure Analysis Services from the start to supplement/replace our ‘old’ SSAS Tabular 2012 production setup.
Promises of using level 1400 features, easy/better sharing to our customers, no management overhead, and all the usual cloud benefits, well, being a small company, the decision seemed like a slam dunk. After the initial test deployment, reality set in and we had to deal with:
Deployment, Processing, Security, Monitoring, Debugging, Stability, Performance and Capacity.
Without having all the answers I’ll share our experience in terms of benefits, challenges and how we made it work.</p>

<h3>€20M+ fines and prison: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is coming, are you compliant? w/ Pete Moore</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Co-presented with Pete Moore.

Do you hold data on EU citizens? If so GDPR applies to you.

From the 25th May 2018 organisations who fail to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure and demonstrate that they are compliant will be liable for a fine of €20M or 4% of annual global turnover – whichever is GREATER. Also, prison.

As a professional who works with data it is wise to ensure that you understand GDPR.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a lawyer.

Let me repeat: I AM NOT A LAWYER.

I am not qualified to give legal advice. However, I do know a thing or two about delivering software. In this talk I will bring your attention to the main aspects of GDPR and discuss some of the consequences this has on the use of production data and database lifecycle management (DLM).

I will focus on technical problems that we need to address. You can (and should) hire your own lawyers to provide legal advice.</p>

<h3>SQL Server  Containers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There's a lot of buzz about containers in tech at the moment but not so much in the SQL Server world which I find odd because as SQL Server people this technology has benefits that we simply shouldn't be ignoring.

My session aims to take attendees through what containers are and how they can benefit us. There are drawbacks which will also be covered but I'm hoping after this session, attendees will be able to go back to their respective companies and be able to evaluate container technology to determine whether or not it will be of benefit.

Attendees will be taken through the following: - 
The definition of containers
Virtual Machines vs Containers
Container networking fundamentals
Configuring Windows Server 2016 to run containers 
Installing the docker engine Pulling SQL images from the docker repository Running SQL Server containers 
Creating custom container images 
A real world implementation of containers</p>

<h3>Maintenance of a DB project and Continuous Delivery using SSDT</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The task seems to be easy. Maintenance of a database project in the code repository, treat it as a master-version and do deployment evenly and frequently. Simple? Seemingly. The things become more complex when the number of objects in the database grows. While instead of one database, we have over a dozen. When databases have got references to each other. And how about dictionary tables? Where to keep them and how to script? Additional issues are coming whilst we would like to control instance-level objects.
I will explain all these topics on the session focused on practical aspects of work with Microsoft Visual Studio Data Tools.</p>
