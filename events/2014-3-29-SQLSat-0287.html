<h3>Recognizing the Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) Workload</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you are like many, you've been hearing a lot about Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) lately. PDW is Microsoft's appliance solution with SQL Server 2012 that allows massively parallel processing (MPP) of database workloads. But how do you know that you have a workload that requires or could benefit from MPP over the standard symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architecture? In this session, we'll review that question and more with a run through of how to identify MPP workloads? As part of the session, we'll also review some of the key components and differentiators of the PDW platform.  You'll leave this session with a clear understanding of the value that PDW can bring to an organization and the types of workloads that it is best suited for.</p>

<h3>Implement a Dynamic Table Partitioning Solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have a large or potentially large database that you would like to partition?  Manually implementing partitioning and the corresponding maintenance can be a lot of work, especially if you have many tables.  In this presentation we look at how you would implement a partitioning solution dynamically for all tables with the designated partition column.  We set it up to keep a FIXED number of file groups.  The partition maintenance will recycle the file groups over time as partitions are dropped and created.  We do as much as possible through dynamic scripting.  This solution can easily be used for archiving but in this example we are simply keeping the most current 6 months of data and dropping the rest.  Assumes you have a basic understanding of SQL Server table partitioning.

<h3>Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.</p>

<h3>Performance-Tuning for Extract/Transform/Load (ETL) Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Much has been written about performance tuning transactional systems and reports, but what about those huge queries used to populate your data warehouse, data marts or large data extracts? What good are reports if you can’t deliver the underlying data in a timely manner? What can be done to make handling millions of rows at a time go faster? In this talk, we’ll go over how to architect an ETL solution that will use every trick in the SQL-Server engine to make data move faster! We’ll be focusing on T-SQL based ETL stored procedures (and a little SSIS) rather than expensive tool-based ETL. We’ll also discuss hardware issues and how to tune processes that you can’t “change”.</p>

<h3>DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.</p>

<h3>PowerShell 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you haven't dug in to PowerShell at this point, you're missing out on some amazing, powerful, practical stuff that could save you time every day. PowerShell does have a learning curve at the outset, especially for those not already familiar with OO concepts or programming in a language like C#, so this introductory session will go through the very basics of PowerShell syntax. If that collection of pipes and hyphens and curly braces seems to be written in some incomprehensible foreign language, this session is for you. At the end of the session you should have a grasp of how and why a PowerShell script does what it does, and the confidence to dig in deeper and begin using POSH scripts in your own work.</p>

<h3>Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Microsoft SQL Server stack provides an excellent set of tools for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data, but sometimes we want to do more. In this session, we’ll take a look at the open-source statistical software R and how we can use it to connect to SQL Server, analyze data, and put the results of our analysis back into SQL Server for later use. We’ll look at examples of analyses performed by a fictional company as they segment their customers, forecast their sales, and examine interesting relationships among their product offerings. Along the way, we’ll see what some of these analyses would take if done in SQL Server itself and why R is so effective when paired with SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Database Snapshots - Making Your Job Easier</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Want to off load some of that reporting workload, make an emergency rollback during a production upgrade faster, or make managing your test databases easier?  If any of these appeal to you, then you should be familiar with database snapshots within SQL Server.  Available since SQL Server 2005, use of this feature can make your life a lot easier.We'll spend the first part of this session taking an in depth look at how database snapshots work. We’ll look at what exactly is happening behind the scenes when you create a snapshot and when you query a snapshot.  Once we've covered the basics, we'll spend the rest of our time analyzing and discussing a number of real world use cases where snapshots can be very beneficial and save you a great deal of time.</p>

<h3>Forward the Federations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you are working with Windows Azure SQL Database (WASD) then you know that the way to scale large data sets is to use federations. If you were using SSIS to move data into a federated database you know how challenging this can be. This year Microsoft released a new SSIS component that handles a lot of the federated headache. I'll give the steps you need to set up federations in your WASD database and how to use SSIS to fill the tables with data. </p>

<h3>Every Byte Counts: Why Your Datatype Choices Matter</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns?  Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why?  Did you know that these Datatype Choices can be a real performance killer?  Attend this session, learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal.  Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now!  When you leave, you should be able to explain why datatype choices matter to your colleagues, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.</p>

<h3>How do I create an automated ETL test suite ??</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are many automated test frameworks available for different types of applications, but Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) data movement applications seem to lack an efficient and easy to use automated test suite. 

We will review how the automated test suite is a data driven approach by showing how the tests self-generate based upon the data in the Information-Model schema in SQL Server and 4 slender custom tables that define the field data mapping between the source and target.

The last half of the session will be a demonstration of the tests to illustrate how they execute. To do this we will quickly review the stored procedure code that generates the tests. </p>

<h3>Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.</p>

<h3>DBA 911 - Database Corruption</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption.  In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands, monitoring for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when to restore versus repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for corruption, identify different types of corruption, and take the appropriate measures for dealing with it.
