<h3>DevOPs and the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.

In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running database hosted in Azure the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.</p>

<h3>Visual Studio SQL Server Database Projects and integrating into VSTS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Some database / data warehouse developers are still using handcrafted scripts to deploy database changes between environments as well developing directly on a database and then scripting changes from that. This was one of the traditional way to do things, but as developers we should not be doing that anymore. Microsoft has provided us an excellent database development tool in SQL Server Database Projects.

In this session, I will demonstrate how to use SQL Server Database Projects, discuss the benefits of using SQL Server Database Projects for authoring databases, and demonstrate the benefits of integrating your database development with Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services.</p>

<h3>A Beginners Guide to HA/DR</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) planning is not just about the technology. When thinking or talking about High Availability/Disaster Recovery, many people jump straight to a particular technology without understanding other factors impacting the solution, and then waste time working backwards to understand requirements. Recovery Objectives, SLA’s and budget are some of the commonly overlooked factors when planning and developing a HA/DR solution. In this session we will walk through the 6 building blocks I take into account when developing a HA/DR solution. You can then use this same methodology to implement High Availability and/or Disaster Recovery in your own environment, working forward to determine the right technology.</p>

<h3>Dip your toe into analytics and data warhousing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So your really familiar with databases - but only from the perspective of an operation DBA.
Your management have decided that they need some reports and they are going to use your systems - and that you are going to build them.
You'll need to design these to work optimally with your current system - and although you've heard and read a fair bit about data warehousing, you have limited experience.
Where should you start? what are your options?
Come along to this session and find out some of the things that you might want to take notice of and some of the options that are open to you as well as ways to make those reports really shine - which will really impress your management team</p>

<h3>Endless Possibilities: R and Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R integration with Power BI provides more flexibility for users. People able to have more visualizations which not exist currently in Power BI such as: normal distribution chart, column width chart, different type of subplots in a map, five dimensions chart with facet and so forth. Moreover, writing R scripts inside power query and Power BI Visualization enable users to do machine learning using R cods. In this session, first I will show how to create some interesting charts using ggplot package inside Power BI. Then, I will show how to do Machine Learning inside Power query by following machine learning process: data gathering, data cleaning, feature selection, model creation, data sampling and finally prediction. I will show how to do predictive analysis using KNN algorithm. Moreover, a short explanation about KNN algorithms concepts will be provided.</p>

<h3>The Tricky Part of Doing Tricky Things in your Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We've mastered the basics of basic database design patterns, but what happens when you or a teammate wants to use THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK to improve on your database design?  Have you just discovered a brilliant new trick that no one else has ever thought of? Or will your new design cost you more, take on more risk and cause all kinds of pain for both IT and your business users?

We'll demo tricks that we've seen in our database design reviews and show you how they work and talk about the trade offs for using them.  You' learn about: Building a database engine inside your database, Implementing Hierarchies, Dealing with data structures that don't do as well in RDBMSs, Generating code out of the database, Optimizing the developer versus the data or the app,  Using design patterns that don't reflect modern architectures and tools, and a lot more.</p>

<h3>10 Amazing Things About Power BI You Don't Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you use Power BI for a real-time dashboard? Have you looped through source files in your Power Query and applied custom functions on them? Have you changed your data model to help Power QA to respond intelligently? Have you head of structured columns in Power Query? Have you used Calculated Tables in DAX? Have you used Power BI Embedded? Have you done many other amazing things with Power BI?

In this session you can expect many live demos and to be impressed by the extraordinary things you can do with Power BI. You will learn tips and tricks to empower your Power BI solution. Tips and tricks that you learn in this session helps you to make your Power BI solution more scale-able, robust, and high performance.</p>

<h3>Get Asynchronous - Build your first Service Broker application</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Service broker provides scalable asynchronous message processing that can prove extremely useful to both DBA’s and Developer’s.
However, Service Broker is possibly one of the least used components of SQL Server despite debuting in the product in 2005.
This session will aim to demystify Service Broker and introduce people to some of the major benefits that it offers.
We’ll build a full application which will demonstrate just how easy it is to get up and running with this technology.
This session is aimed at people with little to no Service Broker knowledge and aims to show how applications can be easily created with Service Broker. You should leave this session with enough knowledge to then take your Service Broker skills to the next level and be capable of handling more complex projects.</p>

<h3>Graph Databases on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Graph database is type of database that uses graph attributes – edges (or relationships) and nodes (or vertices) and features, to store data. Relationship between nodes are through edges and features (also called properties) hold the values to represent the strength or direction of the edges.

SQL Server 2017 offers graph database capabilities to model many-to-many relationships. The graph relationships are integrated into T-SQL and receive the benefits of using SQL Server as the foundational database management system.

In this session we're going to be looking at the key differences between a standard relational database and a graph database, including what datasets are best suited for each type, and how to work between them.</p>

<h3>Patterns For Building Hybrid Scenarios With SQL Server And Azure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server and Azure are built for each other. New hybrid scenarios between on-premise SQL Server and Azure mean they don't have to exclude each other but instead you can have the best of both worlds.

For example, by taking advantage of services like Azure Blob Storage or Azure VMs we can increase the availability of our services or distribute data in smart ways that benefit our performance and decrease cost.

In this demo-heavy session, you will learn the strongest use cases for hybrid scenarios between on-premises and the cloud, and open a new horizon of what you can do with your SQL Server infrastructure.
SQL Server and Azure are built for each other. New hybrid scenarios between on-premise SQL Server and Azure mean they don't have to exclude each other but instead you can have the best of both worlds.
