<h3>T-SQL Brush-up:The Best Things You Forgot You Knew</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p> You’re a good SQL professional – you attend conferences and webinars, you read articles and books, and you know your way around SQL Server. But sometimes – just SOMEtimes – some piece of T-SQL slips by you unnoticed, or falls out of memory. Most of us are working with at least two or three out of the last five versions of SQL Server, so who can blame us for missing a feature or two? Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements. In this session you will see SELECT turned inside-out. You’ll get really, really excited about OVER and PARTITION BY. You’ll learn that Common Table Expressions are, in fact, very cool, and that FOR XML isn’t as scary as it looks. This session is chock full of code examples.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Performance Analysis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance tuning is something that every DBA and developer will have to do at some point.  You'll find all kinds of recipes, cookbook, and processes to do performance tuning.  The hardest part isn't tuning something, it is figuring out what to tune and what is worth tuning in the first place.  Many people don't have the time to do performance tuning, because so much time is spent figuring out what to tune that no time is left to actually tune the code.  This session will take you through all of the tools necessary to gather the data necessary to do the analysis as well as how to quickly cut through all of the background noise to zero in on the most important things that need to be tuned.</p>

<h3>Mirroring: The Bare Necessities</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Remember Baloo the bear from the Jungle Book? Well we are going to get down to the "bear" necessities of mirroring and more. Mirroring can be an integral part of your high availability and disaster recovery planning. We’ll cover what mirroring is, how it can fit into an HA/DR plan, the rules surrounding its use, configuration via the GUI and T-SQL, as well as how to monitor mirroring. This presentation is designed to not only give you an overview of mirroring, but to also walk you through a basic implementation. At the end you will have learned what mirroring is, how it can fit into your environment, what business requirements it solves, and how to configure it.</p>

<h3>Virtualization and Consolidation best practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session you will learn from one of the largest deployments of Microsoft SQL Server with over 5000 servers. Join the experts from Dell Services to learn how, when, and what to do when faced with the question “what is the best virtualization solution to save money on database infrastructure?” Virtualization is knocking on every ones door, including DBAs. Recent economic challenges have forced us all to do more with less. 
You will learn how we managed our internal consolidation efforts. We will cover the best practices for configuring the database engine, Analysis Services and Reporting Services. We also touch on the best practices on virtualization, consolidation and achieving up to 100 to 1 reduction in SQL Servers.

<h3>Analysis Services Performance Monitoring Deepdive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Analysis Services performance troubleshooting can appear more art than science - there are no query plans to view for optimization, server configuration documentation can be sparse and getting consistent results with specific query tests does not always yield the results you desire.  How can you know you can meet the SLAs for the user experience?  What is the performance elbow on the number of concurrent users?  Did my new aggregation or partition actually make a difference?

This session will go into details on how to configure a performance monitoring environment, how to gather data and then interpret results into actionable steps, allowing attendees to answer these questions.  Assumes some experience with Analysis Services and MDX</p>

<h3>The Backup Tune-up</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever gotten tired of your 1TB database taking 4+ hrs to backup? Are you sick of having your users breathe down your neck for 2hrs because it’s taking too long to restore a DB? Well now you don’t have to worry about that anymore. I’m going to show you some little known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would a query. Backups actually have kind of an execution plan that you can access if you know how, and knowing how to get the individual portions of your backup process down will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. I’m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method I’ve used for 15yrs to tune my backups.</p>

<h3>Data File Sizes – How much is enough, if you don’t</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We often run a fine line between how much space we need, and how much space we have for our databases. Having too much drive space can be a waste of resources; however, running out of space is an obvious issue. Let’s find a way to straddle the line and determine just how much space we really need, give ourselves a bit more than that, and make it a regular process to baseline, then continue to monitor, make adjustments along the way if needed, and ultimately plan for just enough space to get us through the year on budget. We’ll talk about a stand-alone tool that I used to determine space use for baseline, continued monitoring of the space used, and ensuring we have enough but not too much space. </p>

<h3>SSIS Done Right With Package Configurations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Everyone starts creating SSIS Packages the same way. We hard code connection strings, file locations, etc. Package Configurations are a powerful way to control your packages at run time. This allows you to seamlessly move packages between servers, dynamically assign data sources and destinations, cycle through data sources, and create reusable code. 

In this presentation, I’ll demonstrate an easy to understand three step process which you can use with all of your packages to increase your productivity in SSIS. </p>

<h3>Data Warehouse Mistakes You Can’t Afford to Make</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many data professionals understand the basics of Data Warehouse design, including Dimension and Fact Tables, slowly changing Dimensions, and the use of meaningless surrogate keys. However, it isn’t until you’ve created a dimensional model and put it into production, that you realize just how much of an impact seemingly trivial mistakes can make. They can hobble performance, allow inaccuracy, and perhaps worst of all, inhibit adoption and usage of the new system. 

Learn how to avoid many common mistakes, from someone who’s made them and then found ways to correct them. </p>

<h3>An Introduction to Profiler and SQL Trace</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Profiler (and its underlying subsystem, SQL Trace) is a tool for recording a SQL Server instance's activity. This diagnostic and performance data is valuable for troubleshooting and characterizing a system's workload. Like any powerful tool, misuse can be quite harmful, so great care must be exercised. This session will teach you how to efficiently configure, run, and analyze the data from traces, while minimizing the overhead of the data collection and avoiding common pitfalls.</p>

<h3>It is TEMPDB, Why Should You Care?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>TEMPDB is just for temporary data right? It is installed by default and gets recreated it time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right? WRONG. This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session. </p>

<h3>Denali AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. Denali AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic ConnectionString fail-over using a real web app to see how well that feature works.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Amnesia</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Losing your memory is never fun.  Well, I can't help you with that, but I can help show you how SQL Server is using its memory and some things to look at with regards to performance problems.

When I started as a DBA I didn't know much about SQL Server internals.  I inheirited quite a few servers and they were experiencing performance problems.  Over time I learned more about the internals and how to troubleshoot systems.  I'll share some stories with you and talk about some of the methods I use to look at how SQL Server is using its memory.  Then we'll look at some examples and demo code.</p>
