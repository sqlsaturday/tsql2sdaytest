<h3>Standalone to High-Availability Clusters over Lunch—with Time to Spare</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Don’t miss this demonstration of the hot new container technology that will change your assumptions about what it takes to implement high-availability clusters. Join DH2i’s Carl Berglund as he transforms standalone SQL Server instances of different versions and editions into an automated HA cluster failing over between systems—in just a few minutes. In fact, he’ll have plenty of time left over to show you some other cool tricks with his new cluster, such as: QoS controls at the instance level, SQL and OS updates as fast as an application stop/start, and multi-subnet geo-clustering capabilities. And you’ll still have time to grab dessert.</p>

<h3>Clusters Your Way: #SANLess Clusters for Physical, Virtual, and Cloud Environments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Clustered implementations of SQL Server instances (FCIs) have traditionally used some sort of attached, or shared storage. However, sometimes that is not the best way to deploy an FCI, especially if you are looking to deploy in the cloud-be it Windows Azure or Amazon EC2. Sometimes you may even want a cost-effective disaster recovery solution without the need for SAN replication. Come hear Microsoft Cluster MVP Allan Hirt discuss your storage options to not only create a #SANLess cluster, but also to increase the availability of your SQL Server instances using SSD and flash-based PCIe storage or the cloud.</p>

<h3>Never Have to Say "Mayday!!!" Again</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>December 1978: 10 people die in a commercial airliner. Why? Bad troubleshooting skills and poor maintenance – disaster-causing attitudes. As you'll learn in this session, the doomed airliner ran out of fuel while the crew of three wasted time troubleshooting a false alarm. We can draw some parallels in the database world. Poor troubleshooting, disaster-causing attitudes, and a lack of disaster preparedness lead to needless downtime and serious user impact across our environments. 

In this session, we'll look at case studies of real-life aviation disasters and production database downtime incidents. We'll see similarities in attitudes that cause disasters. Come learn about the importance of preparation, troubleshooting, and teamwork. This will be an interactive session where we’ll pick apart disasters, engage in discussion around case studies, and leave prepared to change attitudes in ourselves and our colleagues and avoid disasters at work.</p>

<h3>Creating A Performance Health Repository - using MDW</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let's cut to brass tax.  What is the quickest way to create a central performance health repository, where we can continuously collect, upload, store, monitor and report on SQL Server Health of multiple instances?  If you are using SQL 2008 and higher, the short answer is MDW, otherwise known as a management data warehouse.  MDW is a native feature available in SQL Server, "out of the box" - why not use it? In this session, we will take you through the setup, from the wizard and beyond. To creating, configuring, and deploying the MDW in a jiffy, as well as creating custom collections to capture your own desired performance metadata. We'll discuss baselines, trends, and understanding the data. We'll show you the reports as well, and how to expand upon MDW.  </p>

<h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional or tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.</p>

<h3>An introduction to Data Mining</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.</p>

<h3>Auto generating a process data warehouse using Effektor</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In many data warehouses we model fact tables with measures based on attributes which we can count and do arithmetic upon. It is more difficult to handle fact tables with measures based on length of intervals of events happening in the source systems. So questions like "What are the typical waiting times in our order process?" are seldom modelled in the data warehouse. Especially if the event data comes from different source systems. In this talk I will show you how Effektor has overcome this difficult problem using an auto generated data warehouse based on metadata on the objects in the EDW/DM layers. In this approach you can auto generate the process data warehouse if only you have the timestamps present in the EDW layer and are able to correlate them. The talk will consist of slides and demos. Examples is taken from Danish reporting on cancer treatment</p>

<h3>Optimal Infrastructure Strategies for Cisco UCS, Nexus and SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Efficiently managing today’s SQL Server database infrastructure is more challenging than at any time in the past.Today’s server platforms have more computing power and capacity than ever before, but there are also moredatabase applications, many of which need to have very high performance in addition to very high availability.These requirements must also be balanced with an ongoing need for more efficiency and lower infrastructurecosts.In this presentation, you’ll learn why the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) is the optimum platform fordeploying and leveraging the new features in SQL Server 2014. Cisco UCS has a unique and advanced serverdesign that solves many of the business problems faced by legacy servers. You’ll learn how Cisco UCS’s featuresenable you to more rapidly provision and deploy servers, optimize online transaction processing (OLTP) andbusiness intelligence (BI) workloads, and improve the availability of business-critical workloads.</p>

<h3>Is That A Failover Cluster On Your Laptop/Desktop?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the years, one of the most common questions I am asked is, "How can I configure a cluster on my machine?" Ask no more! Production should never be the only place you have clusters. Having the ability to create a cluster that you can use as a sandbox for testing or as an instruction tool for presentations and demonstrations is something every DBA should have in their arsenal.

This session will demystify the "magic" behind configuring a cluster on your laptop or desktop using either Vmware Workstation or Microsoft's Hyper-V, and show how to configure things like the virtual machines, the domain controller, and the storage solution.</p>

<h3>Tired of the CRUD?  Automate it!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>T4 templating support was added in the March 2014 release of SSDT.  This means we can now create a T4 template to automatically create CRUD procedures for all the tables in our database project.  Sure ORM tools like EF and nHibernate can handle CRUD operations in code, but if you want to provide an API to your database and avoid the tedious work of hand creating simple CRUD procedures this is the session for you!

After this session you will:

1. Understand the basics of T4 templating
2. Have a basic understanding of the Dac object model
3. Be able to create a script that will create 100's or even 1000's of CRUD procedures in seconds.</p>

<h3>Why do we shun using tools for DBA job?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the past many years, I have only come across very limited DBAs who actually openly admit use of third party tools that make their lives easier. Otherwise most DBAs find pleasure in writing complex queries to do routine stuff like backups, maintenance, monitoring; you name it. 

I would like to share my experience as a DBA, where I have used tools unashamedly to improve my productivity. 
Hopefuly after this session, you will find the same confidence in using third party tools. Then, use the time saved, to enhance your carreer.</p>

<h3>Leaving the Windows Open</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Computing running totals, averages by state or group, and other complex aggregations are not easy to implement in many relational databases. Thankfully, many relational databases include support for window functions. Window functions are an extension to the ANSI SQL standard. More than just another part of SQL, window functions enable complex ranking, ordering, and other aggregations over a subset of rows in a query. Understanding the capabilities of window functions lets you extend application functionality, build rich and complex queries, and reduce overhead in the application tier.</p>

<h3>Establishing a SLA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most DBA's rarely establish Service Level Agreements (SLA) with the Management and if they do they sometimes just come up with some random numbers for availability. Then when at some point something goes really wrong everybody wonders why it takes so long to bring everything back online.
 
This Session will teach you how to ask the right questions, analyze your databases and servers and generate from the gathered data a realistic SLA.

<h3>Using Extended Events in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  With SQL 2014, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature.  Join me for a little adventure into the realm of extended events.  We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration.  We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events.  This is a fast paced session and will be a lot of fun. Attendees will be able to take back several sample XE sessions to help troubleshoot different issues and get to more intimately know their data/environment.</p>
