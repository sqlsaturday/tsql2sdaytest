<h3>Tabular Modelling and Design Concepts</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Analysis Service in SQL2012 introduces the Vertipac engine and the tabular model.  While the tabular model is delivered through SSAS, the model offers some unique design opportunities for users who would otherwise design a dimensional OLAP solution.  This session looks at tabular modelling by comparing it to the multidimensional model.  We address some of the advantages, considerations and restrictions of the tabular model and examine how the limitations of the native model can be overcome with DAX (the tabular query language). </p>

<h3>Visualising  your data with PivotViewer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Discover the power of PivotViewer, the Silverlight control that enables users to visualise large data sets in an extremely effective and tangible way. Quickly filter, sort and see how your data relates to each other in a way that traditional reports cannot. This session will cover what the  PivotViewer control is and how to get the most out of it with your own data. Even if you've used PivotViewer before, see what's new in the recent Silverlight 5 version to enable you to make the most out of your collections.</p>

<h3>Query Optimizer Deep Dive Pt1</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Take your query writing and performance diagnostic skills to the next level by becoming familiar with the internals of the SQL Server query optimizer and the execution plans it produces.  This 400-level session covers deep optimizer internals and little-known query processor details that will give you new insights into the way SQL Server works behind the scenes.  Armed with this information, you will be better placed to write queries that optimize well, and to debug plan-related performance problems when they occur.</p>

<h3>The MERGE Statement - T-SQL's Swiss Army Knife</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Despite being around since SQL Server 2008 MERGE is one of the most underappreciated features in T-SQL. In many ways it's the Swiss Army Knife, able to be used in many different situations. It's not without it's frustrations though, and you'll see both sides of this useful tool in this presentation.</p>

<h3>The Dark Art of Performance Tuning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Despite all of the enhancements to the instrumentation in SQL Server, many database professionals still view performance tuning as a dark art.  This session will provide database administrators and developers with valuable information on SQL Server performance tuning concepts.  This presentation will walk you through proven performance tuning strategies and teach you how to use SQL Server tools to identify a performance bottleneck, isolate the root cause, apply possible resolutions, and then quantify performance improvements.</p>

<h3>If you had $10K what would you spend it on?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You are looking at the Bill of Materials for the new shiny server that you are going to purchase for SQL Server and you realise that there is still $10,000 in the hardware budget - how do you spend it?  Do you increase the core density, maybe increase the RAM or maybe even look at adding some solid state storage to the storage array.  In this session we will explore how some small hardware investments made in the right place can pimp your next SQL Server deployment.

<h3>Analytic T-SQL Functions in 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are a bunch of new T-SQL functions in SQL Server 2012, and as usual  there's a combination of the "this is really useful" and the "...but there's a caveat". In this presentation, Rob will take you through the new analytic functions, show you how they seriously enhance your reporting ability, and show you some of the ways that they don't behave the way you might expect. You may not be using SQL Server 2012 yet, but you're bound to recognise some of the problems that these functions solve.</p>
