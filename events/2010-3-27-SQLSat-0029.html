<h3>Tuna Helper for SQL Server DBA's</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.</p>

<h3>Tips  Tricks for Writing Better Queries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Transact-SQL is not a very difficult language to learn. As long as the syntax is correct, it can be quite forgiving. However to truly get the best performance from your SQL Server, careful consideration should be given to the structure and logic of the queries. In this session, we’ll discuss some Transact-SQL tips and tricks that can be employed to help you write better queries, allowing your server to perform better.</p>

<h3>Database Design Fundamentals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently). </p>

<h3>SQL Server Locking  Blocking Made Simple</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A good working knowledge of how SQL Server makes use of locking and transaction isolation levels can go a long way toward improving an application’s performance. In this session, we will explore SQL Server’s locking methodology and discover techniques for enhancing query response times.</p>

<h3>Virtualize This!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the list of features of SQL Server growing constantly the need to sandbox and test drive features in a separate environment that can communicate with but not interfere with your existing environment has become vital. With virtualization, setting up consistent test, dev, and even sandbox environments can happen minutes instead of hours AND be consistent with previous/ existing environments. In this session we will focus on Microsoft Virtualization solutions that you can leverage starting with your desktop/laptop and extending to your server environments. Even if you aren’t going to be doing the virtualization yourself it’s good to know what your options are.</p>

<h3>LINQ Kinq for the DBA Guy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of .NET 3.5 and the subsequent SP1, attention has focused upon the legitimacy of Object Relational Mapping systems. Regardless of whether you embrace LINQ to SQL, the Entity Framework, NHibernate, or any of the hundreds of other O/R Mappers, the question remains for the DBA: Is it time to consider alternatives to stored procedures? In this session, we'll introduce LINQ and discuss how programmers and DBA's can work together with these emerging technologies to build robust, performant and dynamic systems.</p>

<h3>PowerShell for Data Professionals </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will learn to perform several everyday DBA tasks like backing up user databases, scripting table objects and evaluating disk space usage with PowerShell. For each task we will explore the benefits of using PowerShell over the standard method. Only a basic understanding of PowerShell or DOS is needed. This session should serve as a good introduction to PowerShell for database users. The goal is to get data professionals feet wet using PowerShell.

<h3>Introduction to SQL Server Integration Services</h3>

<h3>Database Design Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions. In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.</p>

<h3>ASP.NET for the Enterprise with NLB and Clustering</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most ASP.NET Developers are able to build ASP.NET Applications. However, few understand the principles of building scalable Enterprise Applications that are deployable in a Network Load Balanced or Clustered Server network configuration. This seminar targets advanced developers who desires to understand the considerations required in designing and building a scalable ASP.NET Applications. Topics covered in this seminar include: The NLB and Clustered Network Topology, Handling State, Inproc versus SQL Server State Management, Sticky Sessions, Programming Considerations, Database Considerations, and Statistics.</p>

<h3>DBA Repository Update 2010 Using SSRS and SSIS. </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I put together the DBA Repository a few years back and have written and spoken about it for as many years with updates and enhancements over time. At it's heart, the solution employs SSIS and SSRS and in late 2009 I updated it for performance and resiliency. You can read about the original solution in SQL Server Magazine. The latest update will be published in 2010. This will be a sneak peak at those enhancements. The session will cover some interesting uses of package variables and MERGE in SSIS with new reports as well.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Memory Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Like the title says, be prepared to get really down and dirty with memory allocations and usage in SQL Server.  RAM is one of the three pillars of server performance and understanding how it is used, how you can analyze what is going on with it and how to properly adjust the the few knobs you have at your disposal are very important topics for both your server's health and performance.</p>

<p>PowerPivot is an exciting new technology from Microsoft that will allow users to leverage their data to answer many of their business questions. Commonly referred to as "Self Service Business Intelligence", PowerPivot consists of two components, PowerPivot for Excel 2010 and PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010. This presentation will provide an overview of both components then dig deeper into PowerPivot for Excel 2010.

<h3>Parallel Query Execution Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What exactly does it mean to parallelize a query?  Why would the optimizer do this and what are the benefits and what are the drawbacks??  Is it always faster?  Can it cause problems?  Are there reasons we might NOT want parallelization?  These are some of the topics we will cover as we dig into this facet of the SQL Server relational engine.</p>
