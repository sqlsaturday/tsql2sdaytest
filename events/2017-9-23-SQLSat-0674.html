<h3>Move You SQLServer Database to "The Cloud" with Almost No Downtime</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this presentation, we’ll review “What is ‘the Cloud’” and then describe the different methods you can use to migrate your on-premise SQLServer databases into this new environment.  We’ll cover migrations to both infrastructure and database as a service.   We’ll describe in detail how the use of a database replication tool can help you migrate your databases to the cloud with almost no downtime, and reduce the risk of data loss.  We’ll also show you how you can use replication after migration to keep on-premise and cloud databases synchronized, which can help you migrate to the cloud in phases, rather than all at once.</p>

<h3>The first ever SQL Server Drone controlled by Server less Architecture in Azure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using the latest version of SQL Server 2017 , we will control a Drone using NodeJS and with the help of Azure SQL DB , IoT Hub and Azure Bots we will create a continuous integration pipeline . 

Join me in a presentation on how to create your Azure environment for server less Architecture the first ever drone controlled by SQL Server. 

- creating a template to make Proof of Concepts possible 
- real world situations and lessons learned in Azure situations 
- consumption of that data through Power BI.

This presentation will include using Azure SQL DB to call commands to the drone through Raspberry Pi 3, then we will use serverless architecture to connect a cortana channel to make those calls to azure bots which write to the azure sql db, producing seemless intergration with out any on-prem solution.

Continuous development is done through github and Heroku to provide on demand fixes w the drone is still flying.

The future of fast and the furious IoT development coupled wi</p>

<h3>Managing SSRS Reports using PowerShell and SSRS Web Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When you have to do something more than once, you should script it!  That’s true for SQL Server maintenance tasks.  It’s also important for Business Intelligence projects as well.  Microsoft has provided web services to manage your reporting service and to download reports in various forms.  In this session I demonstrate how to leverage these web services from PowerShell to handle common SSRS administrative tasks:  uploading and copying a report; checking the parameter values, setting the parameter defaults, scheduling a cache refresh.  I addition, I demonstrate how to download a report top PDF using PowerShell.  You will not only come away with a set of PowerShell scripts to manage your SSRS server, you will learn how to work around some of the less intuitive features of PowerShell to use and extend these scripts.</p>

<h3>Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.</p>

<h3>Advanced Analytics with SQL Server 2017 and Python</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Looking to find out what is coming next with SQL Server? Thinking about learning a new analytical language to keep up with market demand? You will want to attend this session.
SQL Server 2016 added R to the analytical toolset and SQL Server 2017 is adding Python.  When looking at various lists of the most popular programming languages, Python always has one of the top positions.  This session provides an introduction to Python, including why it is a good choice for analyzing data.  
If you have not had a chance to review SQL Server 2017 yet, please attend to see some of the new changes coming later this year.  One of the features covers will show what is needed to incorporate Python into SQL Server and how Python can be incorporated in stored procedures to provide the ability to analyze data using arguably the most popular programming language to review data.</p>

<h3>The 10 Commandments of ETL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>ETL (Extract, Transform  Load) processes are fundamentally important in any data warehouse environment, and there are many different ways in which to develop the components.

In this session I will share the 10 basic principles I follow when developing ETL processes, and also show how the different choices can affect performance. Following these simple guidelines have resulted in many successful projects and happy customers. I'm sure it will work for you too!!</p>

<h3>The journey to data viz</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You probably have been part of this scenario before...the business needs to answer question Z, without knowing ABC... We will walk you through the steps we follow to efficiently reach the desired outcome.

Steps:
1. Identify sources of data 
2. Data profiling
3. Data cleansing / Business rules
4. Data visualizations (Tableau)
5. Rinse and repeat

P.S - Oh i forgot to say that the business wanted it yesterday. By the end of the session we will outline a frame work that you can adapt to your use case.

All are welcomed to attend the session. Ann is a world class data viz creator with many years of experience and I love to share data solutions.

We both are open to answering questions related to this topic.</p>

<h3>Implementing R  in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Since Microsoft incorporated the R language into SQL Server 2016, there has been a lot of interest in learning not only R, but how incorporating R into SQL Server can provide a greater level of analysis through the use of the complex analytical methods R provides.  This session will show how to run R on SQL Server 2016,  learn about the internals for how R runs within SQL Server, and cover in depth the settings which should be set to optimally run R on SQL Server.  This session will also show some R code to handle some tasks which DBAs now use other tools to complete.</p>
