<h3>Extended Events, Work Smarter Not Harder</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Often, as DBAs, we are presented with the prospect of resolving performance issues. Consider when Bob the Developer shows up accusing the server of inadequacies and expecting resolution. After hours digging through log files and traces and you are able to identify code that Bob deployed that was the root of the problem. What if there was a way to do this type of performance tuning before Bob the Developer shows up and before Sue the User figures out there are performance issues? In this session we’ll take a look at Extended Events and how you can leverage it in every day scenarios. We’ll discuss the ins and outs of how to get detailed information on the errors and events that occur within SQL Server and how to understand the information. </p>

<h3>Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>An often-overlooked aspect to data optimization is what is happens under the covers – how does SQL Server store and access data?  There are plenty of common rules covering tuning, but this session looks at data access from the physical layer, detailing how table access and indexes work, showing why some designs perform poorly, and why adding more indexes may not help.  This will not be a discussion of normal forms or design rules. Instead, it will be a technical session providing the foundation for you to choose which concepts to apply to your designs.
  The session starts with the notion that SQL Server is not a magic box – most of what happens is well-documented and must be taken into consideration when designing or tuning databases.</p>

<h3>Using XML to Query Execution Plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server stores its execution plans as XML in dynamic management views. The execution plans are a gold mine of information. From the whether or not the execution plan will rely on parallelism to what columns are requiring a key lookup after a non-clustered index seek. Through a the use of XML this information can be available at your fingertips to help determine the value and impact of an index and guide you in improving the performance of your SQL Server databases. In this session we’ll look at how you can begin to understand and query the structure of the execution plans in the procedure cache. Also, we’ll review how to uncover some potential performance issues that may be lurking in your SQL Server.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Internals and Architecture</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This fast paced session will take you through many aspects of the internal operations of SQL Server and, for those topics we don’t cover, will point you to resources where you can get more information.  So strap on your silly, as we cover all these topics and more at speed with tongue planted firmly in cheek! </p>

<h3>Tuning SQL Code using Logical Equivalencies</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Sometimes even the right indexes won’t get your queries done in decent time.  In this presentation, we will talk about how to help the query processor out by using different logical transformations on queries, so that they can do the same thing faster.   Examples will be used to create “SARGability”, work with “or” logic and use CTEs or temp tables to reduce work.  The goal is to add new techniques to your toolbox to tune code more effectively.</p>

<h3>SSIS and SSRS Better Together</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)  and Reporting Services (SSRS) are two pillars of Microsoft's Business Intelligence stack:  SSIS gathering the data and SSRS displaying the data.  Do you know that SSRS provides a set of Web Services that SSIS can use to manage and even render SSRS reports? In this session we will develop an SSIS package that exports an SSRS report to pdf format using these Web Services.  Then we will use the SSRS Web Services in a Data Flow Script Component to get data from a report.</p>

<h3>Maintenance Plans - Lessons from the Real World</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Maintenance plans fail - often with no fanfare or warning. Without dependable maintenance plans you can end up with no backups when disaster strikes.    

In this session we will dig into real-world examples of how maintenance plans break and and how to fix them.  We'll also identify the contributing factors that play a part in these failures.  Armed with this knowledge, you'll get sent off with specific tips and general principles you can use to make your Maintenance Plan jobs as dependable as they can be. </p>

<h3>Using Data Mining to Improve SSIS Data Loads</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 provides a powerful data mining environment. These data mining tools can be used to assist with the data cleansing and data validation process during extract, transform, and load process. Let the data tell you which items might be invalid. Only load those records that are most likely to fit your requirements or result in sales. Prevent unwanted data from reaching your database, rather than trying to weed it out later.</p>

<h3>Top 10 Admin Mistakes on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy.  And it doesn’t mean that database administration on SQL Server is problem free.  And since SQL Server is constantly growing from small, home-grown applications, many IT professionals end up encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again.  In fact, wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen? </p>

<h3>Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Having implemented BI solutions for years, I have found documentation to be a task too often resisted until late in the project, when it is hastily and incompletely prepared in remaining hours. Because the integrated Microsoft BI solution comprises multiple application layers, it is challenging to generate documentation about the whole solution in a single, unified document.   In this presentation I will share approaches I’ve come to use in assembling documentation that “covers all the bases.” </p>

<h3>Find Performance Problems by Reading the Waits</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Start with a simple proposition: a process is either working or waiting.  You can tune the working part, but are you seeing the whole picture? There are many different resources on which your process could be waiting - a lock, memory, disk, CPU, and much more.  When a process must wait, SQL Server will log it. There are hundreds of different wait types, and they are a gold mine of data for finding and solving performance problems - and proving the changes worked.  After attending this session, you will be able to gather wait stats and use them to zero in on performance issues affecting your databases.  Stop guessing, start knowing!</p>
