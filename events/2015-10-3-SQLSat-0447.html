<h3>So what does it really take to get to four nines</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As ones responsibilities grow as a senior Database Administrator many more factors come into play to achieving both the realities and perception of high availability.  The building of professional relationships, managing expectations, helping with setting standards and procedures are all critical components to success.   While some Database Administrator will argue this is out of my scope of responsibilities why should I care about building of professional relationships, managing expectations, helping with setting standards and procedures?  The answer is simple because the perception is that no matter where the process breaks down it’s always a database problem.  Managing customer expectations what do you really mean by 99.99% up time, Translating business requirements to operational realities, commonly overlooked items that impact your 4 nines  Avoiding human errors the realities and perception of high availability.</p>

<h3>The "Data Loading Performance Guide" Presentation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. There are quite a few factors that can help, or hurt your goal for tuned performance. For this reason, bulk loading with large amounts of data requires a strategy.

For that strategy, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called “The Data Loading Performance Guide.” The problem is that this guide is long and full of small details that can be confusing and daunting at first glance.

In this session, we will turn this whitepaper into a presentation about creating a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes by applying the techniques mentioned in the whitepaper, as well as other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

We will talk about solutions to achieve High Performance Data Loading, Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading, Indexing Techniques including Columstore, properly leveraging Parallelism and Partitioning, Truncate Partition, PolyBase, Delayed Durability, and more.</p>

<h3>Incremental Load Design Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The volume of data addressed by the typical ETL operation is constantly on the rise.  Not so many years ago, a table with a few million records was considered to be huge.  These days, it's not uncommon to deal with multibillion row tables.  As a result, ETL professionals are frequently tasked with finding efficient ways to incrementally process these large sets of data without resorting to expensive and time-consuming destructive reloads.
 
In this session, we will review the common decision points surrounding incrementally loading data, and will demonstrate some of the methods for incremental processing.  Among the topics of discussion:
--Deciding whether an incremental load is appropriate
--Pick your tool: T-SQL or SSIS?
--Methods for detecting new and changed records
--Common incremental load design patterns</p>

<h3>SSIS Monitoring Framework</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most Organizations use SSIS as the ETL tool of choice for Data movement. These ETL processes can vary from simple to extremely complex processes. Data from these processes can be consumed by a Data warehouse, various other internal systems or for reporting.
 
Monitoring these ETL processes from a centralized location can be complicated, and many times performance issues only become apparent when the process fails or continues to keep running abnormally. 
We shall talk about a framework to proactively monitor SSIS ETL processes for reporting and analysis and to examine performance trends of SSIS packages across servers over time.
 
This session will discuss the SSIS Monitoring framework and demonstrate a few visualizations to show a performance analysis of ETL processes with minimal effort.

<h3>What is the SSIS Catalog? and Why do I care?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2012 redefined how SSIS packages are stored and executed.    The advent of the SSISDB catalog gives a central point for working with SSIS projects deployed to the server.   From this catalog we can set project and package parameter, configure environments, and monitor execution.   There is no need to build in package logging because Microsoft had done it for us.  This presentation covers what is in the catalog, how to deploy packages, environment, tips and tricks as well as  monitoring package execution.</p>

<h3>Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Change Automation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Automation and Continuous Delivery are at the forefront of software development processes today.  However, databases are being neglected because database code is different, harder to automate, and DBAs just don't seem to trust database automation. This is not surprising when you consider the number of incidents and instances of downtime that were caused by out-of-process updates, code overrides, and other database glitches. In this session, we will explain the options to automate database changes along with the benefits and issues with each option.</p>

<h3>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

<h3>Finding root cause for unexplained Availability Group failover</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we will walk you step by step through one or more support cases that demonstrate how we determine root cause analysis of an unexplained failure in an Availability Group.  Whether the databases simply became unavailable, synchronization stopped, or there was an unexplained failover.   We will show you specifically what we look for in the OS Cluster logs, SQL error logs, Extended Events and other sources of information.</p>
