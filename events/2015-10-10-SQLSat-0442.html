<h3>Table Vars and Temp Tables – What you NEED to Know!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represents temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</p>

<h3>Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</p>

<h3>Real World SQL Server Administration with just a bit of sysadmin</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I will review the fundamentals needed to define a configurable permission model currently in use at a large insurance company that allows database administrators to do routine work without having unfettered access to business data. 

I will show that many DBA tasks can be done without sysadmin access and explain what permissions are required for the most common tasks. Attendees will learn how to deploy a permission model that allows DBAs to do routine work and how to elevate permissions quickly to respond to emergencies. 

I will demonstrate several T-SQL and PowerShell scripts that secure the database server, undo the permission model in case of unforeseen circumstances, and discover which servers are non-compliant.

Attendees will leave this session with the realization that DBAs don’t need to be sysadmin as often as typically believed, that most administration tasks can be done without elevated permissions, and with the means to deploy this model in their own environment.</p>

<h3>Detect Worst Performing SQL Queries During Peak Hour</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many times you have been thrown in a situation when you have been asked to fix performance issues of a database system which you have never seen before? Where do you start tuning? When do you stop tuning? Each application is different. With the ever increasing number of systems one production DBA has to manage today, it's very important to use TOP to BOTTOM approach to troubleshoot performance issues, which will lead to the answers in the right way for the application under consideration. 

While you can find top queries, wouldn't it be awesome if you can find out which ones are the exact queries taking most of the resources in last hour and current situation? Now you can focus on those specific queries!

In this session, Prakash walks you through with scenario  demos to find which exact queries are taxing production systems resources based on CPU/DISK/Memory/Network. They are all based on his own real-life experience from managing demanding database systems.</p>

<h3>DQ What? DQ Who? DQ How?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether a company has 1 database containing 1GB of data or hundreds of databases containing terabytes or even petabytes of data, at some point they all have the same question..."What is the quality of our data?". A business runs off of it's data and if that data isn't complete, consistent, and accurate bad decision can be made. Come to this session and learn how to tell if your data is quality data worthy of making decision from. We'll learn what it means to have quality data and how you can measure the quality of your data using the Data Quality Services (DQS) component of SQL Server. Together we'll explore this lesser known part of SQL Server and learn how it works and how you can start using it to measure and improve the quality of your data and thus the decisions being made from it.</p>

<h3>Eating The Elephant; A DBA's Guide to Hadoop  Big Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You're a SQL Server DBA working at Contoso and your boss calls you out of your cubicle one day and tells you that the development team is interested in implementing a Hadoop-based solution to your customers. She wants you to help plan for the implementation and ongoing administration. Where do you begin?

This session will cover the foundations of Hadoop and how it fundamentally differs from the relational approach. The goal is to provide a map between your current skill set and "big data.” Although we will talk about basic techniques for querying data, the focus is on basic understanding of how Hadoop works, how to plan for growth, and what you need to do to start maintaining a Hadoop cluster.  Additional discussion will cover the complementary nature of Hadoop and SQL Server.

Examples and demos will highlight basic query tools, including transferring data to and from SQL Server.  </p>

<h3>Enterprise Auditing with SQL Server Audit</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Audit. The very word strikes fear in the bravest of hearts. But as a DBA, the need to know who is doing what in your production databases is critical.  In SQL Server 2008, Microsoft finally gave us a true auditing tool. But how does it work, what exactly can it track, and how can you handle its output? 

In this session, we cover SQL Server Audit from the ground up. We go from the basics of which events can be audited to a look at how SQL Server Audit works "under the covers", and what that means for performance. While implementing server and database audits, we discuss audit granularity and filtering, as well as the pros and cons of Audit's output options.

Whether it's through the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) interface, via T-SQL, or using PowerShell and Server Management Objects (SMO), at the end of this session you'll be able to deploy SQL Server Audit across your enterprise and manage its output, fearlessly. </p>

<h3>Execution Plans for Mere Mortals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This  session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache.

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.

<h3>SQL SERVER 2016 PERFORMANCE FEATURES</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will cover new SQL Server 2016 features, Query Store and Live Query Statistics. Query Store is designed to help with query performance by making it easier to identify poorly performing statements and finding scenarios where performance regresses.
 
We will discuss how Query Store collects and presents historic information and how it can be used to reduce the time it takes to diagnose and resolve issues. If a query generates different plans, you can use Query Store to analyze the plan changes, identify performance degradation, and even force the query processor to use a particular plan for your query. 

Live Query Statistics is a feature added into SQL Management Studio that provides the ability to view the live execution plan of an active query. This live query plan provides real-time insights into  query execution process as the controls flow from one query plan operator to another. These execution statistics are extremely useful for debugging performance issues.</p>

<h3>Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers</p>

<h3>Entity Framework: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Learned to Love Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have applications in your environment that don't use SQL written by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are the system is utilizing Microsoft's Entity Framework.

Entity Framework (EF) and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is Entity Framework a technology that developers should even be using? In this session, we'll review what Entity Framework is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how Entity Framework works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by Entity Framework. Finally, we'll review T-SQL generated by Entity Framework and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional that manages databases that are accessed through Entity Framework or would like a basic knowledge of how Entity Framework works this session is for you.

<h3>How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.</p>

<h3>Object Level Recovery Made Easy brought to you by Dell Software</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever found yourself in a situation where data mysteriously disappears from your database? Or a stored procedure or function was altered without your knowledge. How do I recover and get back to the original state? Recovering data and/or database code can be a frustrating and time-consuming effort without the proper tools. 

In this session, I will show how to recover data and/or database code using native SQL Server tools. Do I have space to restore a copy of the database, do SLAs allow me to do this now or after hours, etc.

Then I will show how NetVault LiteSpeed for SQL Server's Object Level Recovery (OLR) functionality can simplify the process and get back to the original database state in a fraction of the time. The result is you are the hero and everyone is happy.</p>

<h3>What's New in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 is on the way!   SQL Server 2016 represents the largest release of SQL Server in almost 20 years.  This will be the largest release in SQL Server since SQL 2000.  Why?  After SQL 2000 Microsoft took an approach to have major releases to the Database engine or the Business Intelligence Platform.  That was the pattern for SQL Server 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, and 2014.  In this release we will get change to SSRS, SSAS, SSIS, In-Memory OLTP, and AlwaysOn Availability Groups.  We get new features like R integration, JSON Support, Polybase (the ability to query big data sources with T-SQL), Data Zen Integration, HTML 5 support, and much much more.  If you use SQL Server, this release will impact you.  Come find out how!</p>

<h3>Be the SQL Server Dev/Ops Hero, brought to you by Actifio</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As the value of Dev/Ops becomes more apparent to IT organizations, increasing demand is placed on the SQL Server DBA to manage a more agile and resilient database environment.  A Dev/Ops model requires management of dozens of copies of each database across many servers, The need to provision and refresh these copies quickly is key to the success of any Agile development effort.  In this session we will discuss the SQL Server DBA's role within Dev/Ops - we'll talk a bit about things like Sprints, Chef and Puppet, but most importantly we will discuss how you can present a database to any host in your environment in a couple of minutes regardless of size.  Come see a copy of a 1.6TB SQL Server database presented to a host (same host or different doesn't matter) in less than 2 minutes - try doing that from a database restore!</p>

<h3>Indexing your Data Warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.</p>
