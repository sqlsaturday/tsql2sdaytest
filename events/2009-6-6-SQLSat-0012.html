<h3>XML and Relational Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Well established relational database principles help us decide when and how to use the XML features in SQL Server. The audience will learn what's missing from the typical understanding of first normal form ("1NF") and how to apply 1NF to XML related database design choices. If you think (like many DBAs) that XML is a curse or (like some developers) that XML is a cure-all, this presentation is for you. Contrary to typical technology presentations, this focuses on what we should do over just a list of features and syntax.</p>

<h3>Understanding SQL Injection (DB Devs and Admins)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL injection is a term you've heard often, but do you really understand what it means for a database developer or administrator? Can’t you just leave that to the application developers to deal with?

This session will help you understand what SQL injection is, why it is a risk for your database, and how to guard against it.</p>

<h3>SQL Indexes Implementation in Practice</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Table index design and implementations have significant impact to the overall database performance and operations. In this session Joshua will take you through simple practical steps for:
 - Identifying Missing Indexes

 - Implementing Clustered Index

 - Optimizing Multiple Non-Clustered Indexes for a Table

 - Capturing Index Usages

During the session, your questions and sharing your experience/knowledge are highly encouraged.</p>

<h3>Tips, Tricks and Code on Table/Index Partitioning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Partitioning is arguably the key feature needed to manage large SQL Server databases. In this presentation I will briefly review the main concepts of partitioning and then will provide information from actual experience in implementing partitioning, including code, tips and lessons learned. It is primarily focused on SQL 2005, but will include a brief discussion of the enhancements in SQL 2008. </p>

<h3>T-SQL Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will cover T-SQL coding best practices. The basics on how to code T-SQL statements to optimize your queries will be covered. In this session you will discover some of the common pitfalls that can cause T-SQL statements to run slow. A number of demos will be done to show how by making slight changes in your code will minimize the resources used to process your queries. From this session you will be able to take home a list of T-SQL coding guidelines to help your code more efficient T-SQL statements.

<h3>High Availability on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you need five 9's of uptime? High Availability of applications and databases are rapidly becoming the "norm" around the globe. It is clearly one of the hottest topics that is important for database administrators, data architects and system architects to fully understand and to plan for. 

This presentation covers assessing, planning, choosing, implementing and administering a high availability solution along with the business justifications of different approaches to achieve high availability (including SQL Clustering, Data Replication, Database Mirroring, and Database Snapshots).</p>

<h3>Perf Testing 2008’s Transparent Data Encryption</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Everyone is getting hit with data security requirements. SQL 2005 introduced column-level encryption, but there are drawbacks to using it. The big security news in SQL Server 2008 is Transparent Data Encryption.

On the surface, Transparent Data Encryption seems to be a security "silver bullet". The most important feature (besides securing the data) is that it does not require any changes to your application code.

How much will TDE affect performance in an OLTP environment? This session will help you understand what TDE offers, discuss the list of caveats, and explain the performance testing and results.</p>
