<h3>Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.</p>

<h3>Harassment| Bystander's Guide to Action</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever encountered harassment at work? Me, too.
In your workplace, what would you do if someone was choking?  If their clothes were on fire?  Statistically, you are far more likely to witness harassment. Do you know what to do?
Bystanders have unique power to resolve harassment and restore respect in the workplace. Uncertainty is the biggest reason Bystanders don't take action. Vagueness about what action to take, and when. Indecision about when and what action is warranted. Even doubt about the role Bystanders should play.
In this session you will:
* Bystander will cultivate an awareness about workplace harassment.
* Bystander will learn to employ to observations and interpretation of cues and clues  to workplace harassment.
* Bystander will apply measured steps to develop a plan of action/response  in the face of workplace harassment.
* Bystander will confidently take action using moral courage and candid  conversation to restore respect and resolve workplace harassment.</p>

<h3>To Azure and Beyond:  Create an Azure VM with SSRS server and deploy Mobile and Paginated reports</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSRS Report Server is no long ‘earthbound’; it can live among the ‘stars’ up in Azure!
When we think of Azure, our happy home in the Cloud, we may not think Reporting Services; after all, we have Power BI.  However, even with Power BI, there is still a strong need (desire) for paginated reports in today’s businesses.  So how can we have the best of both worlds; have the data and servers in Azure and still create SSRS reports for the end users?  The answer: create a report server in Azure.  With that, you can host both Paginated (old style) and Mobile Reports.  Steve will deploy both to the newly created VM.
Steve will take you step by step to Build a VM in Azure,  Create a Report Server on the VM, and  Configure the various components; you will be able to see how everything works together.  Come join Steve for this demo heavy session as he walks you through the entire process, including report deployment. Lastly, compare Paginated  Mobile rpts to similar PowerBI. To Azure and Beyond!</p>

<h3>Discovering SSRS 2016 in Azure:  Dataset to Deployment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dataset to Deployment (to Azure!!?) in one session, seriously?  Well, it depends.  Sixty minutes is not enough time to become an expert on how to create a dataset, develop a report with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and deploy the report to a Report Server in Azure; but you can become familiar with the SSRS components and the report deployment process.  Whether you are new to 2016 SSRS or have some SSRS experience, there’s something to learn for everyone.  
In ‘Dataset’, we’ll talk about different options and ideas to create a good dataset.  Then in ‘Develop’, we’ll look at the various components inside SSDT; building a report along the way.  In ‘Deploy’, we’ll walk through the steps to configuration and deploy the report to a Report Server sitting on a VM in Azure.   Yes, Azure! 
By the end of the session, you will be more familiar with the SSDT environment and the report deployment process.  You won’t be a pro after this one session, but you will definitely be on your way!</p>

<h3>Database Design Fundamentals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.</p>

<h3>Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.</p>

<h3>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today, many organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by a member of the VMware's SQL Server Experts Group.</p>

<h3>Intro to Cloud ETL: Azure Data Factory V2</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Data Factory (ADF) has long been a service that confused the masses. With pipelines, data sets, availability schedules, and JSON littering the code based environment it was no wonder the learning curve was steep. With the introduction of Azure Data Factory Version 2 that has all changed. The environment is simplified, scheduling is easily understood, pipelines are more straightforward, and there is more functionality now than ever before. Data Factory now feels like a true cloud-born ETL tool for everyone who is already familiar with SSIS. As a bonus, the lift-and-shift story has never been easier as SSIS packages can now be run natively in ADF. 

 In this session, Brad will walk through the major features including creating the environment, authoring your first pipeline, scheduling, monitoring, deploying SSIS packages, and interacting with on-prem data sets. At the end of this session, you will be ready to orchestrate data movement with Azure Data Factory like a pro!</p>

<h3>Intro to MPP Database with Azure SQL Data Warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When database servers slow down the options are generally to tune or scale up. Massively Parallel Processing, or MPP, databases offer an alternative: scale out. A traditional database engine uses a single processor and memory space to process queries while an MPP engine will divide and conquer by spreading the workload across multiple servers resulting in increased query performance. MPP databases don't operate the exact same as a traditional database engine. In this session Brad will explore the similarities and difference of operating in an MPP environment, dive into distribution theory, discuss join and aggregation compatibility, and get you up to speed on all the basics of MPP theory. By the end of the session you'll be well positioned to understand the design pattern differences, ETL considerations, and query basics of MPP databases.</p>
