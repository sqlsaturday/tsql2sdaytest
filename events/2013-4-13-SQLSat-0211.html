<h3>Hailing Frequencies: SSAS Terms and Concepts</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this Star Trek-themed presentation, we will explain the terms and concepts important to understand when participating in projects involving SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).

You’ll learn the key differences between SSAS Multidimensional Model (Cubes) and SSAS Tabular Model. You’ll also learn the definitions and examples of key terms for each model, including but not limited to: measure groups, measures, dimensions, attributes, and hierarchies in the SSAS Multidimensional Model and tables, columns, and calculated measures in the SSAS Tabular Model. We will also demonstrate the basics of browsing of both Multidimensional and Tabular models using Excel 2013.</p>

<h3>Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve been using SQL Trace and Profiler since you started using SQL Server.  They’re like old friends, tried and true.  You know how they work, you know what you can capture, you know how to find the data you need.  But now you’ve been told that your good friends have been deprecated in SQL Server 2012, and you need to become best friends with Extended Events.  What is THAT all about?  It’s ok.  Really.  In this session we’ll look at Profiler and Extended Events side by side to see how easy it is to transition to Extended Events.  We’ll step through real world examples using Extended Events to do what you’re used to doing with Trace, and even more.  You can find the time learn Extended Events…today.</p>

<h3>Analytic Cartography: Master geospatial reporting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the hottest trends in analytics right now is geospatial reporting. Long gone are the days of viewing region based data in a grid. Now it is possible to provide users with additional insight on the regional performance of business.

In this session, Julie will show you three options for creating and delivering these analytics. First SQL Server Reporting Services 2012 will be presented to show how we can create custom shape objects to conform with business defined regions. Secondly, using the power of Excel 2013, Bing Maps and GeoFlow, learn how to build captivating visualizations directly in Excel. Finally, we'll show how easy it is to build interactive maps using Power View.</p>

<h3>Demystifying BISM and Tabular Mode SSAS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SQL 2012, Analysis Services (SSAS) has seen some major changes.  An entire new method of modelling analytic data has emerged and it's called Tabular Mode Analysis Services.  In addition to that, a new semantic layer has been added to the tool, the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM), which will help to bring the two modes -- Multidimensional and Tabular -- into one level playing arena.

In this session, attendees will gain understanding of what Multidimensional and Tabular modelling IS, as well as how the BISM layer helps to translate user requests to ensure no confusion is made. Attendees will also learn how to BUILD a Tabular model, and will help design a solution live during the presentation. </p>

<h3>Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</p>

<h3>Monitoring and collecting storage info for DBAs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As an admin, we need to keep an eye on storage: What is the total size and available size on disk devices? What about mount points? How much space does each database take? What about breaking that down into schemas, tables, data size, and index size? Granted, some of that can be seen through Management Studio reports, but what if we want to keep a historical record of all that for planning and trending purposes? What if we are on a tight budget and cannot afford monitoring software.

In this session, I will explain and demo a PowerShell/SQL Server combo solution that is simple, elegant, and works! You will come away with code and instructions on how to implement it.</p>

<h3>Anatomy of a Join</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A lot of database professionals today  do not have a Computer-Science Degree  so they never attended a  “Introduction to Databases” course. In this session we are trying to fix at least one thing and we’ll look in depth at the three types of join operations, visualize how their algorithms work in order to understand how query plans are computed, explain why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific  join operator to use in a query plan. Will demonstrate that empirical cost calculations are similar to what Query Optimizer actually outputs. Good understanding of join algorithms is vital in order to diagnose and remedy issues related to bad query plans.</p>

<h3>Demystifying Database Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database statistics are not made up numbers, like the statistics you may hear on TV or read in a news article. They are critical metadata used by SQL Server’s query optimizer. In this session, we will look at statistics from the ground up and remove the mystery that surrounds them. Demos and real-world examples will be used to explain what statistics are, why you should care about them, and what you can control. 

By the end of the session, you will understand: 
• How to view statistics and interpret the histogram 
• How and when to update statistics 
• How statistics affect the query optimizer 
• When you can let SQL Server manage statistics, and when you need to step in </p>

<h3>Dashboard Do's and Don'ts</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SharePoint makes it easy for users to create their own dashboards but there's more to dashboards than just fast and easy set-up. This session will explore not only the characteristics of an effective BI dashboard using SharePoint 2013, but also the design flaws to avoid. Attend this session and learn how to perform a dashboard makeover. Starting with a review of a dashboard that uses technology correctly but not as effectively as it could, you’ll explore common problems found in dashboards, learn the characteristics of good dashboard design and discover how to implement a dashboard that communicates information clearly and concisely. </p>

<h3>Discovering the Plan Cache</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

<h3>PowerShell 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you haven't dug in to PowerShell at this point, you're missing out on some amazing, powerful, practical stuff that could save you time every day. PowerShell does have a learning curve at the outset, especially for those not already familiar with OO concepts or programming in a language like C#, so this introductory session will go through the very basics of PowerShell syntax. If that collection of pipes and hyphens and curly braces seems to be written in some incomprehensible foreign language, this session is for you. At the end of the session you should have a grasp of how and why a PowerShell script does what it does, and the confidence to dig in deeper and begin using POSH scripts in your own work.</p>

<h3>Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>These terms seem to be thrown around all the time – but what do they all mean? In this session we’ll explore the different isolation levels in SQL Server and how they affect the way that blocking and locking behave within the database engine. We’ll dive into the most common locks and how they can be leveraged and avoided to improve your application experience. Once locks are explored, we’ll discuss the dreaded deadlock and discuss techniques to detect and mitigate this troublemaker in your environment.</p>

<h3>Rules of Engagement: NoSQL is SQL Server's Ally</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When should you favor a NoSQL store over SQL Server, or consider polyglot persistence? In military and police operations, the rules of engagement determine when, where, and how force shall be used. As the “data police”, we are responsible for determining when, where, and how data is stored. As SQL Server professionals, it tends to be our first choice, even when there are other data storage options that are a ‘more natural’ fit. In this session, Rick and Dave will start with the NoSQL basics, and then dive into the different categories of NoSQL stores while explaining what each type is well suited for.

<h3>What Are You Waiting For?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve spent the afternoon sweating over your T-SQL query. You’ve wrung out all of the wrinkles. It’s deployed, it’s running… now its waiting.

<h3>Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning seamlessly solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</p>

<h3>An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS.  However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case.

After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server.  We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate.

Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2012 Memory Management</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2012 brings a wide range of changes from its previous versions - one key change is the way SQL Server memory is managed. With releases prior to SQL Server 2012, there were 2 memory managers, these have been merged into 1 with the latest version, and that’s just the start of the changes for SQL Server memory. 
This session will dive into questions related to memory primarily for SQL Server 2012. </p>

<h3>What is a BI DBA?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever read a job description (or needed to hire one yourself) asking specifically for a “BI DBA” and wondered what exactly that means? In this session we will discuss the expectations of the role, what the various pieces of the Microsoft BI stack are and what administrative components and gotchas are involved for each one. If you need to unveil the mysteries and intricacies of administrating an SSIS, SSAS and/or SSRS environment from a DBA perspective then check this session out!</p>

<h3>Flipping Through the SSIS Catalag</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SQL Server 2012 one of the biggest changes for SSIS Administration was the addition of the Integration Services Catalog and using parameters. The Catalog is the storage and logging location for SSIS 2012. Parameters are the new configurations in SSIS 2012 and once you start using them you will never go back. Package Variables, Configuration Strings, Package properties can all be configured using Parameters. You will learn how to create the catalog, use parameters to deploy packages through different environments and use the built in reporting to monitor packages as they run.
