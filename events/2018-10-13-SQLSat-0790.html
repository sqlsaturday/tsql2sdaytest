<h3>New Security Features in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It seems like that every month we hear about another company having a major data breach. GDPR raises the stakes with huge fines for those that lose or don't keep data safe.
Ensuring that your data is secure has become more important than ever.

With this in mind, in SQL Server 2016, Microsoft gave us three new features that have the potential to improve the security of your SQL database, either on premises or in the cloud.
These are:
Dynamic Data Masking which allows us to obfuscate data in real time
Always Encrypted which helps protect data both at rest and in motion with a master key 
Row Level Security that gives us control over who can see which rows in a table based on the user's rights

In this session we will have an overview of these important security features and demos on how to configure them and make them work.</p>

<h3>Datawarehouse Lightning Performance with Columnstore!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>During this session we will be talking about Columnstore Indexes and how to use them. We will be showing you tips  tricks on how to get the performance you want out of Columnstore.
We will show you the concepts on how to efficiently load data to your Columnstore tables, how to get your Columnstore properly created, and some dangers with performance you might face when working with Columnstore Indexes as seen in the field!
After this session things like segment elimination, auto adjust buffer size, Delta Store,... will no longer be a mysterious concept for you  you will be ready to start implementing the different flavors of Columnstore Indexes in your environment.</p>

<h3>dbachecks - The PowerShell Module to validate your SQL Estate</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a SQL DBA you want to know that your SQL Server Estate is compliant with the rules that you have set up. Now there is a simple method to set this up using PowerShell and you can get the results in PowerBi or a report emailed to you on a schedule. Details such as

How long since your last backup?
How long since your last DBCC Check?
Are your Agent Operators Correct?
Is AutoClose, AutoShrink, Auto Update Stats set up correctly?
Is DAC Allowed?
Are your file growth settings correct, what about the number of VLFs?
Is your latency, TCP Port, PS remoting as you expect?
Is Page Verify, Data Purity, Compression correctly set up?

and many more checks (even your own) can be achieved using the dbachecks PowerShell module brought to you by the dbatools team.

Join one of the founders of the module, Rob Sewell MVP. and he will show you how easy it is to use this module and release time for more important things whilst keeping the confidence that your estate is as you would expect it</p>

<h3>Moving advanced analytics to your SQL Server databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Traditionally advanced analytical solutions, like machine learning, require you to bring your relational data to the machine learning model. Your model would then perform a prediction and return the results. While the process described above is reliable, it involves moving your data between the database where it is stored and the location where your model resides. This also means an increase in the complexity of your analytical solutions. For instance, how do you trigger the scoring of new data as soon as it enters the database? Or, how can you design this process for real-time scoring?
With the release of SQL Server 2016 Microsoft integrated a solution to the questions above, in-database analytics, allowing you to bring the analytics to your data instead of the other way around. Through in-database analytics we can design, train and score models directly from SQL Server without moving data out and back into the database.</p>

<h3>Combining Azure Cognitive Services and ML.net for AI empowerment!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will look at ML.net and the different cognitive services to empower your solutions with AI. One of the large set of new features that will be covered is the customization feature of the cognitive services to fit your challenge. With this demo full session we will use custom vision to build/train and deploy a model with the power of the cloud. ML.net will be used to incorporate the trained model into an application without the need to call the online services. 

This by using Microsoft Cognitive Services and ML.Net:
•	Microsoft Cognitive Services is a collection of cloud-hosted API’s that empowers every developer to easily add AI capabilities for vision, speech, language, knowledge and search into applications and devices. 
•	ML.NET, a cross-platform, open source machine learning framework. ML.NET will allow .NET developers to use and develop their own models and infuse custom ML into their applications</p>

<h3>Embedding PowerApps into a Power BI Dashboard</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowerApps are a relatively new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technology released within the Azure stack.  Its primary focus is to empower technical and non-technical developers to create fast, simple custom apps.  They can be used as standalone apps or embedded within websites/mobile apps.  On the other hand, Power BI is now a mature product and needs little introduction.

What if we could use PowerApps and Power BI together?  Can we embed a PowerApp into a Dashboard/Report and give the end user the ability to write back data to a visual?  How does the Common Data Service (CDS) 2.0 and CDS for Analytics (CDSA) impact the integration and functionality between both applications?

The 1-hour session includes other technologies such as Azure SQL Database, Common Data Service (CDS) and Flow.  In particular, I will demonstrate how you integrate these technologies with PowerApps and Power BI.  Whilst all levels of expertise are welcome, users require prior knowledge of Power BI Dashboards and</p>

<h3>Simplifying XEvents Management with dbatools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events are much more powerful than any other monitoring technology available in SQL Server. Despite this potential, many DBAs have yet to abandon Traces and Profiler. Partially because of habit, but mostly because the tooling around Extended Events was less intuitive until recently.

Now, it's easier than ever to set up, control and inspect Extended Events sessions with dbatools! Not only does it simplify your basic interaction with XEvents, but it also helps solve your day-to-day problems, such as capturing and notifying deadlocks or blocking sessions.

Join SQL Server MVP Gianluca Sartori and PowerShell MVP Chrissy LeMaire to see how PowerShell can simplify and empower your Extended Events experience. Say goodbye to #TeamProfiler and join #TeamXE with the power of dbatools.</p>

<h3>Not just polish – How good code also runs faster</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I want to show you how just a little neater and tighter code can also run a lot faster. These are some of the instant performance improvements that won’t change a lot of code, won’t generate weeks of testing and validation for your colleagues, and can be relatively quick to implement.

But most of all, they’ll make the code prettier and easier to understand for the next person.

We’ll look at common ways that null values, implicit datatype conversions and foreign key constraints can radically affect the performance of your queries. Inspired by an actual client case, where I tuned a 20 hour query down to a few minutes, with only a minor code change.

This presentation is all-code, some execution plans, and no-powerpoint.</p>

<h3>Deep dive into Adaptive Query Processing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Until SQL Server 2016, the Query Optimizer and the Execution Engine were strictly separated. The Query Optimizer produces an execution plan that, based on statistics and estimates, should be fast. That execution plan is then faithfully executed by the Execution Engine, even if reality turns out to be different from expectations.

SQL Server 2017 changes this! Three new features now allow execution plans to adapt to reality. Memory Grant Feedback increases or decreases assigned memory based on past experience. The Adaptive Join operator allows the optimizer to create two alternative plans, the best of which will be decided at execution time. And with Interleaved Execution, parts of the plan are even completely recompiled mid-execution, with much better cardinality estimates.

If you are more interested in how all this ACTUALLY works than in shiny marketing slides, come to this session. We will spend the full 60 minutes knee-deep in execution plan internals!</p>

<h3>Start testing your SSIS packages with ssisUnit</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do you test your SSIS packages? Do you prepare them, set the parameters and variables, maybe get some sample or production data and run few times by hand in SSDT? It’s not a bad practice when you start your ETL journey, but after some time you probably think about automation. If not – you should. Perhaps you have some SQL scripts that verify data in the tables after package execution, but if you are like me, somewhere inside you feel that it’s not enough. It’s time you start automated SSIS unit and integration testing.

On this session, I will show you how to start with automated testing of the packages and the whole projects using ssisUnit – the free SSIS testing library. I will start with some basics and move forward to the real-life examples of the unit and integration testing of the SSIS packages/ projects/solutions. You will see the benefits of automated testing and that testing is hard only at the beginning.</p>

<h3>Automatisch werkproces met Microsoft Flow en Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Je gebruikt verschillende applicaties om je werk goed te organiseren. Outlook, Onedrive, Sharepoint en Power BI, allemaal voor een ander doel. Microsoft heeft Flow geïntroduceerd om deze applicaties met elkaar te laten praten. Dit geeft ons de mogelijkheid om eenvoudig geautomatiseerde werkprocessen op te zetten. En het mooie is, je hoeft geen ontwikkelaar te zijn!

Power BI kan hier een belangrijke rol in spelen. Door het genereren van data alerts in Power BI kan je een email sturen, werktaken maken of zelfs een heel nieuw werkproces starten. Je kunt ook automatisch data naar Power BI publiceren vanuit Outlook en Sharepoint zodat emails en documenten kunnen worden geanalyseerd.

In deze sessie introduceren we Flow en kijken we naar use cases om Power Bi te integreren in werkprocessen. Aan de hand van demo’s krijg je een goed beeld hoe Power BI samen met Flow kan worden gebruikt in het automatiseren van je werkprocessen.</p>

<h3>U-SQL custom extractor for multi-gigabyte XML</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With emerging industry data standards like ISO20022, FpML, XBRL, HL7 etc. XML is getting more and more common as a standard for exchanging data. The advantages are numerous, but mainly on the definition and validation part of the story. When the XML is getting heavy - let's say > 1gb - many out-ot-the-box approaches start running into processing issues and the XML gets too big to handle.

During this session we will explore and compare DOM, Streaming, LINQ, XPath, and .NET serialization for processing big XML. In the final Azure Data Lake approach, you will see how to separate the concerns of large file handling and parsing complex XML. Running on Azure Data Lake enables for integrating this into your serverless big-data pipeline.

Hands-on stuff where solutions will be shared with attendees.</p>

<h3>Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance, concurrency and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, all ORMs suffer from the same flaws.</p>

<h3>Automating Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI is easy for end users but tends to be hard for Operations people.
Deployments tend to be all manual which is error prone and possibly not compliant.
Monitoring usually is not in place or done manually as well. This means developers have no idea who is using what, Operations has no metrics telling them ideal planned maintenance windows, licensing issues, compliance issues, etc ...
Depending on audience choice and time, we'll cover Power BI Service and/or the on-premises Report Server.
You'll walk out of this session knowing:
- Why and how to automate deployments
- Why and how to set up monitoring</p>
