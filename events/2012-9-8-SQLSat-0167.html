<h3>Reporting Services Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoft’s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - New Features included in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access. ** This session is SQLSaturday favorite and is always packed full. Don't miss it **</p>

<h3>Data Quality Services--Finally!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every organization that stores data stores dirty data, and suffers with how best to handle this unpleasant fact.Organizations must rely on people to deal with data problemseither by paying them to clean it or paying them to work around it. Either way it is costly and only becomes more so over time. Finally with the release of SQL Server 2012, there is a tool to help. Learn how to use the key parts of Data Quality Services: how to create a Knowledge Base, how to create Data Cleansing Projects to cleanse data both in the DQS client and inside SSIS 2012, and how DQS Matching Projects can integrate with Master Data Services for de-duplication of data. Session focuses on DQS, but also explains how DQS, MDS, and SSIS work together.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.</p>

<h3>Production is all Virtualized, Is Yours?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I don't know how the Sql Server will perform!  You can't do that! Yes, we can!  Yes, we did! It runs better than our physical server.  Need to add a CPU in less than 5 minutes, no problem.

What is causing my Sql Server to run slow, is it the virtual, operating system or Sql Server? How do I know? What is the licensing for Sql Server? How do you monitor it? How is it working? Let’s find all of these answers.</p>
