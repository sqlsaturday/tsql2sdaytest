<h3>Data Modeling for the Modern Data Warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A theoretical discussion on two methods that professional data modelers use to model data (ERD and star schema). 

We discuss why we need to model data, benefits / value of modeling data, and why we select one modeling technique over the other. Once we understand why and when we use these different modeling techniques, we will focus in on dimensional modeling that is used when developing data warehouses, SSAS cubes and Power BI. 

Sample diagrams will be used to explain these different modeling techniques and try to bring a more tangible aspect to the theoretical aspects of the discussion.

Why Model Data
•	The Value of Enterprise Data
•	Why Should We Data Model
•	The Multifarious Data Environment
•	Business Benefits of Data Modeling

Different Model Types
•	Enterprise Model 
•	Conceptual Model 
•	Logical Model 
•	Physical Model 
•	Dimensional Model

Different Modeling Techniques

<h3>Proper DataType Usage=Guaranteed Better Performance and Accuracy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. 

In this demo-heavy presentation I will show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for its usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of inappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition I will cover several data type related functions, and point out caveats in their usage. I expect even advanced T-SQL developers and DBAs to walk away with a useful nugget or two.</p>

<h3>SQL Server on Linux, a new frontier</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>At one time, Microsoft SQL Server was only available on the Windows platform.  This expanded to the Azure cloud environment, though still on the Windows platform.  One stronghold of the other RDB vendors remained and it has a significant installed base, Linux.  Well, not just Linux, but "Open Source" systems and those derived from the open source operating systems, OS X included.  
With the release of Microsoft SQL Server for Linux, this last major hurdle in the enterprise is starting to fall.  There is much more product development work needed to catch its older brother, but Microsoft SQL Server for Linux has become interesting and viable for the enterprise and hobbyist.  Join me as we take a look at what is currently available in Microsoft SQL Server for Linux.</p>

<h3>PowerBI, from a DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft’s PowerBI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement PowerBI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point PowerBI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, PowerBI, and how to make these work for you.</p>

<h3>Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.</p>

<h3>Implementing Python in SQL Server 2017</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 added R to the analytical toolset and SQL Server 2017 has added Python.  When looking at various lists of the most popular programming languages, Python always has one of the top positions.  This session provides an introduction to Python, including why it is a good choice for analyzing data.  
If you have not had a chance to review SQL Server 2017 yet, please attend to see some of the new changes coming later this year.  One of the features covers will show what is needed to incorporate Python into SQL Server and how Python can be incorporated in stored procedures to provide the ability to analyze data using arguably the most popular programming language to review data.</p>

<h3>Solving Common DBA Problems With R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>External script languages were introduced to SQL Server in 2016, starting with R and continuing with Python in SQL 2017.  To familiarize myself, I attended various community sessions, but each one was about statistics, anomaly detection, or forecasting.  That's all interesting, but it’s not my thing, so we won't be talking about any of that!  This is a demo rich session about things you didn't know you could do from SQL Server with the help of R, such as parse JSON or convert to CSV, integrate Azure Key Vault for securely storing passwords, get documents from Azure Cosmos DB and add them to your data warehouse, archive tables across platforms, quick and simple ETL, and finding out easily which column of data is causing that "String or Binary data will be truncated" error.  Come join me for some eye opening demos about the many practical uses of R for non-statisticians!</p>

<h3>Very Large Databases in your future</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Your databases may not be terabyte-sized yet, but they're probably growing every day. We'll look at lessons learned 
from working with multi-terabyte, very large databases (VLDBs) in the real world. Topics include storage layout 
decisions, unique tuning challenges, HA/DR implications, and database restores, along with shoehorning backups, re-
indexing and DBCC checks into itty-bitty maintenance windows. As a bonus, many of the techniques also apply to smaller databases and consolidated servers that run hundreds of databases.</p>

<h3>Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain estimated summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues, how to find them, and how to solve them, that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys (the most prevalent statistics based performance killer?), correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information. There’ll be many examples, and even a stored procedure to help you find ascending keys. By applying the techniques we’ll discuss, you WILL see improved query performance.</p>

In this session we will take a brief look at all of the considerations and best practices when developing Power BI models, reports and dashboards.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Azure SQL Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What is this “Azure SQL Database” that I keep hearing about? In this session we will start from the beginning and answer the big questions around what it is, how you use it, how to monitor cost, and most importantly why you would and should use it in your particular environment/situation.</p>

<h3>Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree (from a user perspective)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session dives down and looks at the important items on data pages of clustered, non-clustered, and unique non-clustered indexes using the DBCC Page command. It will also look at the effect of row data compression on clustered and non-clustered indexes. In all demos we will try to ascertain how the SQL Server® optimizer might use them and also strive to gain some insight from a performance advantage.  Its purpose is mainly to try and understand how SQL Server implements indexes, their underlying structure, and where performance benefits might lie from a layman’s viewpoint.  Session is 80% demos.</p>

<h3>Open Source vs SQL Database Maintenance Plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Database Maintenance plans used to be a one size fits all tool that did a lot of unnecessary work, especially, when it came to indexing. So I have been recommending that clients use other tools such as Ola Hallengren’s award winning free SQL Server Maintenance Solution. So let’s have a showdown at high noon in the Arizona desert and see if Database Maintenance Plans in SQL 2016 and 2017 are now good enough or if we still need to turn to other solutions like Ola’s.</p>

<h3>Use PowerShell and dbatools to Manage your SQL Server Environment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did you know there is an amazing open source community driven to make your SQL DBA life easier?  The PowerShell dbatools suite not only save you time, but will provide you a better understanding of how your environment is configured.  
In this session, you will learn how to standardize, monitor and alert on your environment when SQL Server settings fall out of best practices, using tools provided in the dbatools suite.</p>

<h3>Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks, Oh My!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>"I've got a locking problem", "I need to get rid of blocking," and "deadlocks are normal behavior" are all things heard way too many times.  

In this session targeted at the accidental or new DBA, we will walk through each of these items, what they are, what their causes are, which of them are normal behavior and which are not, and some common causes of deadlocks and excessive blocking.</p>

Ever wonder if there is a better way?  Well wonder no more.
