<h3>Now Where Did THAT Estimate Come From? - Part 1</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there?

In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are built and maintained and how they are used to estimate row counts. But you will also learn how filters and joins influence those estimates.

Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries.</p>

<h3>Go, Go, QueryStore!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the hardest things to do in SQL is to identify the cause of a sudden degradation in performance. The DMVs don’t persist information over a restart of the instance and, unless there was already some query benchmarking (and there almost never is), answering the question of how the queries behaved last week needs a time machine. Up until now, that is. The addition of the QueryStore to SQL Server 2016 makes identifying and resolving performance regressions a breeze.

In this session we’ll take a look at what the QueryStore is and how it works, before diving into a scenario where overall performance suddenly degraded, and we’ll see why QueryStore is the best new feature in SQL Server 2016, bar none.</p>

<h3>Shedding some light on Windowing Functions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Windowing functions in T-SQL add power and speed to your queries, and have myriad uses in all types of situations.

Songs by The Beatles spent a combined 585 weeks on the Top 100 Billboard Chart.

In this session, we'll combine these unlikely bedfellows, by using The Beatles' chart data to gain an in-depth knowledge of Windowing Functions in T-SQL. Learn the theory behind each clause in the Windowing Functions and immediately see it applied in both an abstract, and concrete, way.  Learn how Windowing Functions can help you enhance your queries, and solve complex problems quickly and easily. From running totals, to lag and lead queries, Windowing Functions will help you deliver high quality information in no time. Once you've seen the power of these functions, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them. Understanding Windowing Functions may seem like a "Long and Winding Road", but "Come Together" and walk away with a skill that you'll use "Here, There and Everywhere".</p>

<h3>Creating an adaptive party domain model in SQL Master Data Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>People and organisations fulfill a crucial role in running a profitable business. Every organisation dealing with customers, employees, suppliers, to name a few, should have an easy to maintain, central master data repository to manage this data. If your master data is sorted, you ensure your business processes can fire on all pistons. How can you tackle this challenge in SQL Server Master Data Services without having to build 10 different domain models for each possible role? A flexible, adaptive party domain model is the answer.

In this session I will take you through the approach and the various modelling steps to set up a party domain model in the SQL Server MDS environment.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2016 Database Administration for the non-DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you a developer or a systems admin and you've just been handed a SQL Server database and you've got no idea what to do with it?  I've got some of the answers here in this session for you.  During this session we will cover a variety of topics including backup and restore, recovery models, database maintenance, compression, data corruption, database compatibility levels and indexing.

While this session won't teach you everything you need to know, it will give you some insights into the SQL Server database engine and give you the ability to better know what to look for.

During this session Microsoft MVP and Certified Master Denny Cherry will give you the basic information that is needed to get that new SQL Server that you've just been told that you need to manage running and safe. After this session you will be armed with the basic information needed to know how to properly backup the database so that you can recover it after a failure. You will learn how to properly maintain t</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2016 Efficient and Effective coding of Stored Procedures</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data does not become information until decision makers are able to view it and make those decisions that affect the enterprise as a whole. Stored procedures are one means of getting the data from the database tables to the reports in an effective and efficient manner.
In this hands-on presentation, we shall be looking at best practices with regards to creating and tuning stored procedures. We shall also be discussing parameter sniffing and other gotcha’s that affect us in our daily lives.</p>

<h3>SQL Server and Application Security for Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A lot of companies have a philosophy of "ship early with as many features as possible.” Security is an afterthought since it isn't fun to do and no one will attack them anyway. However, the dark side never sleeps, and security breaches have always happened, often leaving companies severely exposed or even bankrupt.
In this session we'll look at a few attack vectors that can be used against your company, and what you as a developer can and should do to protect against them. It will involve a good mix of security conscious SQL Server and application development, because you care about your work and nobody messes with you.</p>

<h3>The NoSQL DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When NoSQL first became popular the "No" in NoSQL was advertised as the end of relational databases.
Fast forward a few years, and the "No" now means "Not Only" as traditional and document stores live happily side by side.

The manufacturers of these NoSQL systems have also realized that SQL is the language that is used to manage and query data - SQL is well known and there are many people that are very good at it.

In this quick session we will look at N1QL (pronounced Nickel) which is the Couchbase query language, and how your skills in relational can cross over into NoSQL by only learning a few extra keywords.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Database Design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Far too few database developers in this day and age get the opportunity to learn how to design relation databases.  In most cases, they will on occasion be asked to add a few objects to an existing system while following the standards of the organisation. These relatively infrequent changes do not hone the skills needed for effective design.

This session will go through the fundamentals of database design.  Topics such as normalization, Understanding Data Relationships as well as the Language of  Data Modeling and Design will be discussed. The Database Design Sequence Phases of Conceptual, Logical and Physical will be introduced as well.</p>

<p>I am determined to bring the ‘Human Element’ back into today’s Recruitment Process as I believe it has been lacking for too long now! I believe that people are the core building blocks of every business but that doesn’t mean that we can treat every ‘block’ the same. I have over 13 years’ experience in the Recruitment Industry and I have specialised in the IT Applications space for most of this time. I have recently decided to flex my entrepreneurial muscle and I have launched my own Sourcing Training Business. I am passionate about raising the standard of Sourcing in Africa.</p>
