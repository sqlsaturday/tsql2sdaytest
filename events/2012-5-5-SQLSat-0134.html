<h3>SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a cooking analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.</p>

<h3>PowerPivot with NASA data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power Pivot is an amazing tool for mashing up data from a variety of sources ~ in this session, we will combine data from NASA, OpenGOV, and other publicly available sources, as well as from a prebuilt cube, to show the power of user driven analysis, and visualisation in Excel.
Using DAX, you will see how to create time-intelligence driven visualisations, and then dive into the new enhancements for the date table, relationshios, perspectives and KPIs.
As an added bonus, you will see how to pull the model into Visual Studio, decorate it with new attributes, and show the visualisations in other tools such as Performance Point and Crescent (PowerView)</p>

<h3>Layered partitioning in a Data Warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How does one load a large fact table in a Data Warehouse, when the source system can deliver any chunk of the data at any given time? This session will show how to handle this by using layered partitioning. We will walk through table partitioning, partitioned views, and layered partitioning, as well as go through the management and performance benefits (and challenges) partitioning gives us.</p>

<h3>Bad plan! Sit!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Bad execution plans are the bane of database performance everywhere they crop up. But what is a bad execution plan? How do you identify one in your system and, once identified how do you go about fixing it?

In this session we’ll look at some things that make a plan ‘bad’, how you might detect such plans and various methods of fixing the problem, both immediately and long-term. </p>

<h3>Data has "R" value</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many companies take data for granted, and see it as a liability instead of an asset. In this session we will discuss some of the elements of how you can start to measure the “cost” of your data and if that data was lost what would it cost the company to recover. Your companies data must be a measurable asset.</p>

<p>A family man, Christian, starcraft addict with some SQL on the side.

Working on SQL for a long time, started on V6.5. I have seen way to many versions of SQL/BI tools for any sane person. ‘There is evil here that does not sleep” and as far as I can will help where I can. As the “about” title says I wear sandals (Afrikaans: Plakkies) do not like shoes to my wifes/boss dismay. I enjoy going off-road with my “toyota” and when I am not “sql”ing I will be constructing something from wood.</p>
