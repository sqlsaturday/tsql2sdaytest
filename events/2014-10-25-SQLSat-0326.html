<h3>Location Location Location Preparing and Presenting Geographic Data </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will begin with the tasks necessary to model a dimensional data structure to maintain and present geographic data.  We will discuss various requirements that can affect a data model such as granularity, surrogate keys, slowly changing dimensions.  Real life examples and solutions will provided to give better context to each step in the process.
After the data structure has been created we will focus on how to best “clean” and validate the geographic data.  We will focus on using SSIS to obtain latitude and longitude and then how this can be converted SQL Server spatial types.
Finally we will cover presenting this data using SSRS and Power Map and how to create dynamic and aesthetically pleasing graphical reports.  This portion of the session concentrates on presenting reports using the geographic data type that answer specific questions such as:
Events that occurred at a specific address, zip code, and even block range and events within a mile radius.

<h3>An introduction to Business Intelligence and Big Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The problem with the old way of organizing and analyzing data in RDBMS is that it is painfully slow, incomplete and costly. We are obligated to be selective and work with data in small chunks. In the best case scenario we partitioned our data and archived it with the hope to eventually use it, but the fact is that when data is being archived, usually, it is never used again. We don’t even bother with collecting all the data due to economics and technical limitations. 
In this presentation I will introduce BI and Big Data, explain advantages and disadvantages of OLTP, OLAP and Big Data.
