<h3>High-Performance Statistical Queries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Transact-SQL language in latest editions of SQL Server has so many business intelligence (BI) improvements that it might become your primary analytic database system. You might even decide to use T-SQL for advanced analyses directly, without including R, SSAS or Azure ML. However, to get the maximum out of these language constructs, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows extremely efficient statistical queries that use the new window functions and are optimized through algorithms that use mathematical knowledge and creativity. During the session, the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures are explained as well. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries. Or maybe you want to become a data scientist? Then you need to know statistics and programming. You get the best of both in this session.</p>

<h3>Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Machine learning service is Microsoft Azure drag and drop tool for building,testing and deploying any kind of predictive model on your data-set. Finalized solution is published and used by daily business in larger stack of your Microsoft Azure services. With easy and interactive creation of models, algorithms and decisions do not tend to be that simple! Especially when one has to make business decision on results.

Focus on this session will be mathematical and graphical explanation of algorithms available for predictive analytics in Azure Machine Learning service. Algorithms - grouped by learning type - will be examined and crossed referenced through all available and ready-to-use. Understanding the the basics - data inference, data splitting, data stratification, to sweeping, to theory of algorithms: regression, decision trees, Clustering and Naive Bayes. We will clarify the confusion over algorithms, suitable data for algorithms and what type of problem can be tackled with.</p>

<h3>Notes from the field of a Microsoft SQL Engineer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Being part of Microsoft is challenging. But also rewarding. With the countless cases of pretty and not so pretty SQL Servers. With so many good, but also bad practices. Cases going from badly written code to cases with improper plan caching. And I want to share them all with you. So let's hope we have enough time to do that!</p>

<h3>Think  work like a Data Scientist with SQL 2016 R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What are these DATA Scientists up to? How can we see their statistical model in our day to day familiar tool like Microsoft SQL Server?

You now have answers to these questions and thanks to Microsoft for integrating R Revolution within new SQL Server 2016. We all now have the opportunity to use R packages and see the results within SQL 2016.

In this session, you will definitely take away a breakthrough concept of Advanced R Analytics within SQL 2016 and get ready to kick your creative horse, and go beyond your imagination on how you can build advanced analytics and impress your employers/customers.</p>

<h3>Problem Solving With The In-Memory Engine</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is a vast array of material in the SQL Server community that covers the in-memory engine in great detail, this session will cover some of the internals of the in-memory engine, however what it will also do is fill in the void as to common performance issues and how they can be solved with the in-memory engine, specifically:

- Staging data as fast as possible
- Turbo charging scalar aggregate functions
- Implementing a scalable sequence
- Overcoming the performance limitations of temporary tables
- Making the critical path in your code base run faster</p>

<h3>Spatial Analytics with SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Spatial dimension of business such as ‘where are things happening’ and ‘where are my customers’ becomes more and more important. An unprecedented amount of location-referenced data that will be produced in years to come has to be not just stored, but more important analyzed on strategic, tactical and operational level, sometimes in (near) real time. This session covers use cases and best practices for spatial analytics and shows significant performance improvements in spatial with SQL Server 2016 and demonstrates synergy offered in Azure ecosystem.</p>

<h3>SQL Server and JSON in real applications</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>JSON support that was introduced in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database enables you to get the best both from relational and NoSQL worlds. You can easily combine relational design that provides high query performance and non-relational concepts that provide you flexibility and rapid development to create optimal design for your application.
In this session, we will see how you can combine relational data and JSON, query and index JSON data, load semi-structured data from log files, create REST/OData services, and easily integrate your database with modern web apps.</p>
