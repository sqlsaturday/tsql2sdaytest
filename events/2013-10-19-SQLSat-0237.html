<h3>Inferred Dimension Members within MDS and SSIS </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Combining Master Data Services with Data Warehouses, will cause some challenges in ETL Scenarios. In this session we will go through a demo of Inferred Dimension Members implementation with SSIS considering the fact that MDS keeps the single version of truth for the dimension record.
In this session you will learn how we will write back new record's data into MDS entity as an Inferred member. The staging structure of Master Data Services and Batch Processing will be used for this. Then you will learn what is the best practice to add the inferred record into Data Warehouse dimension. Updating the existing dimension member also would consider the Inferred member and apply SCD types only if this is not an inferred Member.</p>

<h3>Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</p>

<h3>Change Data Capture tool for BI,Auditing,DR  more</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the newest features available since SQL Server 2008 which allows you to easily track and keep history of all DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes on user tables such as INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE without additional overhead. One of the most important benefits of this feature is that it allows you to see the data before  after an UPDATE statement which allows you to recover data overwritten or deleted quickly without the need of a database restore. On this presentation we will go over the steps necessary to configure CDC and do an overview of some real world scenarios where this feature can be applied such as in ETL for Business Intelligence, Disaster Recovery, Auditing, and more.</p>

<h3>Understand Evaluation Contexts in DAX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DAX is the query and programming language for future Microsoft BI solutions, yet many users found DAX hard to learn because they couldn't grasp what the "context" was. This session will turn you into a DAX expert by mastering this core concept of DAX. You will learn what row contexts and filter contexts are and how to access them. You will learn functions which create row and filter contexts. You will learn the initial contexts of a calculated column expression, a row level security expression, and a measure expression. You will learn how initial contexts are created from an MDX query. You will learn how to manipulate filter contexts using the overwrite and intersect semantics. You will see a lot of examples and learn a few DAX tricks along the way.</p>

<h3>DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.</p>

<h3>Automating SSIS Development with Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, there are some painful shortcomings that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, and create packages directly from schema information and other metadata.  The free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). 
In this session we will start by showing the power of Biml.  We will then step back, and start from the beginning of using BimlScript.  Once we cover the basics, we will cover practical examples using the BIDS Helper add-in to automate SSIS development.</p>

<h3>Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... 

In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.</p>
