<h3>Keeping up with SSMS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Starting with SQL Server 2016, SSMS became a stand-alone product.  Updates are sent out a lot more frequently than in the past and it can sometimes be difficult to keep up with all of the changes and new features.  There were 7 new version releases in 2017 and 8 new version releases in 2018.  With all of the new releases, are you using SQL Server Management Studio to its fullest?  We will discuss some of the features available in the SSMS v17 and v18.

On top of the new versions, there is a lot of cool stuff available in SSMS that you may not be aware is there.  We will discuss and demonstrate some features offered in SSMS that will help make Developers and Database Administrators more productive (and everyone wants to be more productive).  Whether a DBA or a Developer, you will take away knowledge about the new SSMS versions along with some useful SSMS tips/tricks to use in SSMS that you can apply in your day to day activities.</p>

<h3>The next generation of Business Intelligence is done with DevOps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The next generation of Business Intelligence practices is about improving effectiveness and accuracy. The simplest, most efficient way to do that is through DevOps.  DevOps for BI is no longer just getting your schemas into version control.  DevOps can bring the entire agile lifecycle to the BI world.  Agile development and continuous integration will improve the customer experience.  Advancements gained from using DevOps in BI are improved accuracy, consistency, and faster delivery.  DevOps for BI is a methodology of development, testing, QA, and Implementation that will increase the success of your projects and enhancements. This session explains with real-world examples the issues and solutions we have seen that will convince you to adopt this methodology.  We will walk through the steps to expand on what you do now and the efficiencies you will gain by starting or expanding your use of DevOps in your BI environment.</p>

<h3>“Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this second of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn of several incredibly easy modifications to your Index Maintenance routines to actually prevent fragmentation for weeks rather than perpetuating it,  virtually eliminate “Bad” page splits, reduce wasted memory, make your log file  log file backups a whole lot more happy and increase the overall performance of even perfect code.

We’ll also learn that no simple method is a panacea, what to do about the horror of "expAnsive" updates, and how to make even GUID-keyed indexes work well.</p>

<h3>Accelerate SQL Server Migration to the AWS Cloud: Approach and Methodology</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In today’s marketplace, moving to the public Cloud(AWS) is a familiar and consistent trend within the SQL Server community. After all there are so many offering choices between AWS EC2 and RDS, each with their own distinctive features. Migrations to the cloud are only going to gain greater momentum as organizations grapple with their on-premises alternatives. 
In this presentation, we will discuss various methods and explain the advantages and disadvantages of using each method along with best practises. We’ll also showcase the surprises and pitfalls to avoid as we venture into the process.
Learn more on what trends you can expect to see, what the future holds for public clouds, and see how the DBA role and their responsibilities are undergoing changes to fit into the new profile necessary in managing the cloud framework.</p>

<h3>Creating Accessible Power BI Reports: Challenges  Opportunities</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Accessibility is catering for your whole audience, including those with disabilities. According to the US Census Bureau, 19 percent of the of the population had a disability in 2010. Do you know if your reports are designed in an inclusive way such that everyone can use them? This can be especially important if you are making reports for government entities, educational institutions, or the general public. In this session, we'll discuss accessibility standards and regulations of which you may want to be aware, how users with disabilities can consume Power BI reports, and guidance and pitfalls when designing inclusive reports.</p>

<h3>“Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this first of two back-to-back sessions on the subject, we’ll explore what happens to an index in the first year of its life for four different common Fill Factors along with how “Best Practice” methods executed once per week and once per day have their way with you, your indexes, your log files, wasted memory, and the performance of your code even if it’s perfect code.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the R Programming Language for BI Professionals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The modern BI professional is taking on the challenge of operationalizing data science. Most BI developers are very strong in TSQL but their exposer to advanced statistics and visualizations were limited by what is available in the TSQL language. The R programming language allows us to clean, visualize, and apply advanced statistical methods to data. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to use R Studio to generate and test R scripts; generate R visuals in PowerBI; call R code in machine learning workflows; and execute R code in SQL Server. Additionally, I will cover these R programming fundamentals: creating and assigning variables; performing simple calculations; understanding R data types; vectors; matrices; factors; lists; data frames; and ggplot2 graphics.</p>

warehouse databases when it comes to indexing?
This session is a deep dive into
 Clustered indexes
 Non-clustered indexes
 B-Tree traversal
 Primary Keys
 Covering indexes

This session will feature live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using
statistics and query plans. Understand indexing like a rocket scientist by attending this session!

<h3>Say Anything: Using knowledge base, NLP and AI to enable customer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today companies have an abundance of unstructured data. It exists in emails, text files and documents. It is not easily searchable and usable without a lot of prep work. But this data contains valuable information! 
Companies can use this new information in many different ways, for example to enable customers for a self-service support. Customers might be looking for the same answer, but they will likely ask their questions in different ways. Customers really want to be able to ... say anything.

<h3>Building Composable Query Abstractions in TSQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A common critique of SQL is that it can be hard to write queries with reusable parts, something which is trivial in many programming languages. For example, even something simple, like running a query with different set of selections can be tricky to express. 

This presentation will show how this problem can be avoided by taking a data-first approach and using some advanced TSQL constructs. Along the way, we will also go over how to do GraphQL-like queries in TSQL.</p>

<h3>The very Model of a Modern Day Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Gilbert and Sullivan never had to create a database. But you do. This session will delve into details of the system databases.
These are created when the system is installed and then DBAs pretty much forget about them.  If you ask, they might have an idea of what their use is, but the truth is, they're sort of a black box to many.

This session will cover how and when to back them up, how to move them if necessary and how to take advantage of that "model" database that seems to just sort of sit there.</p>
