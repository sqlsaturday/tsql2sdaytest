<h3>That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.</p>

<h3>How Cloud Computing Empowers a Data Scientist</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The last few years, we have seen an explosion in data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The rise of cloud computing has been a major factor in this explosion. Cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Azure, enable users to quickly spin up clusters of computers to perform the high-performance calculations required by data science problems. 
Azure offers a number of tools for building data science solutions: From a drag and drop interface to Jupyter Notebooks as a service to a Virtual Machine pre-configured with powerful Machine Learning tools.
In this session, you will learn how the cloud has impacted data science, the most useful tools in Azure for a data scientist, and when it is appropriate to use each tool.</p>

<h3>Using Extended Events for Wait Stats Analysis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views for examining wait statistics from the instance level to the database level, all the way down to the individual query level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods including T-SQL queries and SQL 2017’s new XEvent Profiler, and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.</p>

<h3>Encrypting Data within Sql Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep off of the data breach list? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt?  What else can you do to protect your sensitive data?

In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption and Always Encrypted. The session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share my experiences implementing the encryption. In addition, the session will review auditing of sensitive data usage.  

You will leave the session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance.  In addition, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.</p>

<h3>Azure SQL Database Managed Instance for DBAs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is a deployment model of Azure SQL Database, providing near 100% compatibility with the latest SQL Server on-premises. Managed Instance allows existing SQL Server customers to lift and shift their on-premises applications to the cloud with minimal application and database changes. At the same time, Managed Instance preserves all PaaS capabilities (automatic patching and version updates, automated backups, high-availability ), that drastically reduces management overhead and TCO. 
In this session, learn:
1. Lift and Shift - Features compatability
2. Fully managed PaaS - what does the DBA need to manage
3. Full isolation and security - VNet support and security
4. Sizing and limitations
5. Best practices from customer deployments
6. Roadmap</p>

<h3>Automagic Tuning - SQL Server 2017 and Beyond</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Identifying and fixing problematic query plans got a lot easier in SQL Server 2016, with the introduction of the Query Store. SQL Server 2017 takes that power a few steps further. Have you ever:

•    Had a query suddenly slow down at 2 AM when you were on call?
•    Seen a query that received a giant memory grant that brought the rest of the work on your server to a screeching halt?
•    Had the optimizer choose the wrong type of join and send your query off to never finish?

Don’t worry, you will still have your job, but the features introduced in SQL Server 2017 will make narrow your focus to the absolute worst queries in your environment. You will also get a sneak preview of what’s coming into future releases of SQL Server in terms of performance.</p>

<h3>High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

Cloud  Datacenter MVP David Bermingham takes explains all this and more in the session.</p>

<h3>Get started with Power BI Dataflows</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data preparation is often the most labour-intensive component of any analytics project yet getting this right is vital if outcomes are to be accurate. While the growth of self-service BI empowers users to explore their data, the task of collecting and cleansing this data often requires more experienced hands. 

Dataflows are an extension of the Power BI ecosystem, providing a low code approach using Power Query to create curated datasets that can quickly be consumed by business analysts, improving the speed at which business value is delivered. Dataflows can also be used to provide the single version of the truth that has traditionally been provided by data warehouses. 

During this talk, we will demonstrate the creation of a dataflow using multiple data sources and also have a look at how you can get started for free using your Power BI Pro subscription.</p>

<h3>Revenge: The SQL!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?
Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</p>

<h3>Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ll find a lot of Word of Mouth (WOM) advice out there about SQL Server performance, especially when it comes to indexes. Some of the things you have probably heard are:
 keep clustered index width small
 unique indexes perform better
 keep non-clustered index width small
 compressed indexes have fewer logical reads
 add one index for each column

But how do you know if this advice is good or bad? Did you know that there is a way to look under the hood at the actual index pages to see how the data is stored, and how it’s stored differently when data is compressed? Using this information, you can prove or disprove the WOM advice.
Attend this demo-heavy session to learn how the SQL Server optimizer uses indexes. It’s all about performance, and the right indexes will give your application a big performance advantage.</p>

This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!</p>

<h3>Azure SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.</p>

<h3>Analyzing Performance Problems Using XEvents, DMVs  Query Store</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events, Dynamic Management Views, and Query Store are highly useful tools that give you a lot of data when analyzing performance problems. The challenge is which tool to use for which problems and how to correlate the data.

You are troubleshooting a performance problem in a business-critical database, a query is not completing, the users are complaining, and you are trying to understand what is happening. You have data from Extended Events, you are looking in the execution related DMVs, and now you are trying to find the query in Query Store. How do you put it all together?

In this session, we will look at how the tools work in different scenarios, how to correlate the data, and how you can use them in your performance troubleshooting.</p>

<h3>Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!</p>

<h3>Is my SQL Server having Memory Pressure?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As we all know, SQL Server loves memory and will use as much as it can get.  However, when there is memory pressure we need to use our DBA skills to identify what is causing the pressure.  During this session we will explore how SQL Server uses memory and how to properly configure memory settings.  We will discuss the use of DMVs and other tools to help us find what is consuming the most memory and some potential solutions.</p>

<h3>Modern Infrastructure Fundamentals for Database Professionals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Since we live in a world where physical deployments are more the exception than the rule, the infrastructure underneath our databases is similar, yet very different. There is still CPU, disk, and memory but what does that actually mean today? 

This session will update the core infrastructure concepts anyone responsible for SQL Server should know whether you have physical, virtualized, or public cloud deployments. As a bonus, you will be able to work better with the other administrators back in the office now that you can speak their language. 

If you want to ensure that your SQL Server deployments are available, reliable, and perform well, this is the session for you.</p>

<h3>PowerShell for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.</p>

<h3>Modern CPU Architecture and SQL Server Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, and instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers.</p>

<p>I started as a night shift computer operator out of high school. I moved to applications development after graduation from SAC. After a few years with the State as an applications developer, the manager of Systems Programming decided it would be better to have me on the inside looking out rather than on the outside trying to get in. I spent the next 14 years as a mainframe system programmer for two state agencies. In 1996 I moved to Healthcare IT and have been that ever since. I’ve spent most of the past 14 years doing ETL, performance and HIPAA security. In these various jobs, I’ve used all manner of databases including InfoTec IMP, IBM VSAM and DB2, Interbase, Informix, Universe, Oracle 9i and SQL Server from 6.0 to 2008 R2.</p>
