<h3>Business Intelligence: Decaffeinated Please!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For many Database Administrators, Data Analysts and other IT and Business Professionals, Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Warehousing (DW) may be a new and uncharted territory with no clear path towards the destination. Others, who have already jumped head-on into the Business Intelligence journey, may be facing challenges that can potentially put their efforts at the risk of failure.In this session I will go over some of the basic concepts that are key in understanding BI and DW. I will also go over the natural roadmap towards BI success, its maturity stages and some of the factors that influence a successful BI project. I will exemplify all these concepts by showcasing a successful real-world BI and DW solution.</p>

<h3>Transition from DBA to BI Architect</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database Normalization and Dimension Modeling are the same but different. Development in today ‘s larger industries require the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). My transition from Senior DBA to BI Architect at Amedisys has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end result analytics/statistics from smaller and smaller transactions. From previous experience, I know I am not going to get it right the first time. Lessons learned will mold me into a great BI Guy.</p>

<h3>Enhanced contextual help for Reporting Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Participants will be shown concepts depicting expanding contextual help for Report Builder 3.0 and beyond and be asked to provide feedback to help us choose between competing designs.    Previous customer comments and 2 benchmark tests of RB 3.0 have provided those areas that we think could benefit from this approach which we think might be an alternative to Office Ribbon contextual help.  Participants will help us determine future of delivery of on-line and local help with inputs to MSDN and TECH Net for the Business Intelligence products.</p>

<h3>Implementing a Data Cleansing Component for SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>To ensure consistency across data integrated from multiple systems, the application of standard data cleansing routines is a best practice. Examples of data cleansing include translation of NULL values to defaults, trimming string values, and consistent formatting for textual data such as telephone and social security numbers. While these routines can be implemented using standard SSIS components, the resulting logic must be duplicated for each source and column which creates a development and maintenance burden.  This session will walk through the process of creating common data cleansing routines in a custom component to enable code reuse with minimal effort across many packages.</p>

<h3>SSIS and SSRS Better Together - Long</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)  and Reporting Services (SSRS) are two pillars of Microsoft's Business Intelligence stack:  SSIS gathering the data and SSRS displaying the data.  Do you know that SSRS provides a set of Web Services that SSIS can use to manage and even render SSRS reports?
