<h3>Image classification with Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is called electricity of the 21st century. 150 years ago the invention of electricity changed our whole world. Today, thanks to AI, we are facing a revolution on a similar scale.
This breakthrough was possible due to use of deep learning models for such tasks as image and film classification, sound recognition and natural language processing. All of these skills that people come naturally are relatively difficult to machines. Only a combination of three factors: a large amount of available training data, blazing fast computers and innovative deep learning algorithms allowed computers to see, hear and understand colloquial language.
During this session we will learn the principle of deep learning models for visual recognition, starting from linear models and model hyperparameters, through general neural networks, to convolutional neural networks. All this theory will be augment by examples — we will build and compare different models using Cognitive Toolkit.</p>

<h3>Beyond image classification - object detection  with multi-task deep models</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Object detection can be challenging to understand, mostly because there is a gap in the literature between image classification and object detection — the former is explained in deluge of easy to understand blog posts and articles, the latter is the subject of research papers, full of scary looking math.
In this session we will take different approach and built state of the art object detection model in easy to understand steps. First, we are going to make sure that everybody understand concepts of convolution networks, the importance of  model architecture and loss function. 
Then we are going to build a model that will classify single object, a model that finds this object on a picture, and a model that combine both and is able to classify and localize the largest object in each image.
Finally, we will move to multiple objects detection, discus latest architectures and design appropriate loss function for this task. All this illustrated with examples built using fastai library.</p>

<h3>Designing your tabular/PowerBI model for performance and scalability</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You developed a PowerBI or an Analysis Services Tabular model and you run it on a server with plenty of cores and memory. But your queries does not scale or your users are not happy with the performance! So what can you do? You can fine tune the settings of your AS Tabular (usually does not bring a large benefit), you can scale up (which is costly) or you can apply the techniques I am going to show you in this session. Techniques, that range from optimizing the storage of your model, to how to effectively implement DAX patterns for maximum performance. And all of that, complemented with digging into engine execution plans, DMVs, tracing activity and tabular engine internals.</p>

<h3>The Maths behind Machine Learning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The new world of Machine Learning can sound quite overwhelming! Do I need a PhD in Machine Learning to get involved? The answer, thankfully, is no. But what you do need, which is often neglected, is a solid understanding of the theory behind the models.

This session will look to do just that, looking at some of the most popular algorithms used today, we will explore the maths involved, to help us understand our problems and get the best results possible. We will be also diving into practical examples, using Databricks to consume a dataset and to visualise results, with R scripts to execute the Machine Learning models.

If you would like an introduction to the world of Machine Learning and to acquire a solid grounding that will help you develop the skill, then this is the session for you.</p>

<h3>Deadlocks. Everything you ever wanted to ask but were too shy.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It's not a secret that a deadlock - it's not very good. Definition of deadlock is very simple and quite clear: This is an exceptional situation when two concurrent queries request same resources but in a different order. 

Classic deadlock can occur when two concurrent transactions are modifying data from the two tables in a different order. Unfortunately, in real life deadlocks often are more complex and unobvious. One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: "You can not design a database, in which the occurrence of deadlock is impossible". And we should deal with them. The algorithm is simple: 
1. Catch the deadlock
2. Find the root cause
3. Design and implement a solution. 
In practice, these steps can be tricky and may require different types of analysis. 

In this session, we will look at ten various deadlocks scenarios and find the root cause of the deadlocks. Then, you will see how it will be easy to get the solutions for the deadlock issue if we did the second step.</p>

<h3>The Road to The Autonomous Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Autonomous means capable of existing independently. Think maintenance free, self-healing, auto-tuning databases able to detect and automatically mitigate security risks. Sounds like impossible dream, but here is the best part - Azure is gradually making that next level of automation possible. Cloud economy of scale combined with unique features of Azure Sql PaaS resources transform and enhance the way we collect, store and process data. And that also affects our professional lives. Find out where we are on The Road to The Autonomous Databases, what are main building blocks, what kind of obstacles we still have to overcome and how to turn these challenges into opportunities.</p>

<h3>Data Preparation for Machine Learning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If there is one crucial thing in building ML models, this would be the data preparation. That is the process of transforming raw data to a state where machine learning algorithms could be run to disclose insights and make predictions. Data preparation involves analysis, depends on the nature of the problem and the particular algorithms. As far as there are knowledge and experience involved, there is no such thing as automation, which makes the role of the data scientist the key to success.
ML is trendy and Microsoft already have more than 10 services to support ML. So we will focus on tools like Azure ML Workbench and Python for data preparation, review some common tricks to approach data and experiment in Azure ML Studio.</p>

<h3>Query tuning when indexes cannot help</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Creating an index seems to be a silver bullet for optimizing a performance of a query. If this is true, then most of performance problems seems to go away, but they exist. And there are lots of cases when creating yet another index doesn't help. When do indexes help and when do you need to just take a different approach - rewriting the query for removing bad patterns. In this session I will show you how to decide to create an index or not, and which query patterns don't benefit from indexes. You will see some reason of the plan warnings, cardinality errors, and how to avoid them.</p>
