<h3>Moving Enterprise database to cloud</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Windows Azure provides several different ways of storing and managing data. Windows Azure SQL Database and SQL Server in Windows Azure Virtual Machines are solutions in Windows Azure for working with relational data. If you are familiar with SQL Server, Windows Azure SQL Database will be a natural extension of your knowledge and skills. 
In this session, you will learn: 
1)	Windows Azure SQL Database - Learn how to get started. We will explore how to migrate an existing on-premise SQL Server database to Windows Azure SQL Database. We will then walk through how to manage and administer your Windows Azure SQL servers and databases. 
2)	 Provision the SQL Server VM on Windows Azure - We will learn provisioning the Virtual Machine through the Windows Azure Management Portal. Once created, we will open the VM through the Remote Desktop . Finally, we will connect to SQL server  using SSMS.

<h3>Somebody got BIDS Helper in my Data Tools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you develop SSIS packages, SSRS reports or SSAS cubes (multidimensional or tabular)? Then this class is for you! We'll cover the capabilities this free tool empowers you to perform as well as address some of the grating little quirks of BIDS/SSDT. 
Analysis Services Multidimensional: Roles Report, Printer Friendly Dimension Usage

Tabular: Tabular Actions Editor, Tabular Display Folders, Tabular HideMemberIf

SSRS: Delete Dataset Cache Files

SSIS: Deploy packages from BIDS/SSDT, Identify items with configuration/expressions, Create packages based on templates, Find differences between packages

Learn about this perfect combination from Meagan Longoria and Bill Fellows and you'll never want to have your BIDS without the helper.</p>

<h3>Don’t Miss Out on Excel Cube Functions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cube functions have existed since Excel 2007, but they’re not as well known nor as well publicized as other methods to obtain data from Analysis Services/PowerPivot sources. Business Analysts may feel confined to tabular (symmetrical) reports with pivot tables. BI Developers may avoid Excel because they want the ability to write calculations in MDX and the extensive formatting capabilities of Reporting Services. And Power View limits you to the sets, calculations, and captions available in the data source and doesn’t provide drillthrough detail. We’ll start with the basics of how to write and use cube functions, then employ them to build a nicely formatted, asymmetrical, parameter-driven report that overcomes the previously noted limitations. In addition to facilitating new methods for data retrieval and report design, learning cube functions can help business analysts understand the MDX language and BI developers appreciate the power of Excel’s formulas and formatting options.</p>

<h3>What SQL DBAs need to know about SharePoint</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the number of deployments of SharePoint exponentially growing every day, as a DBA, it is very likely you are going to have SharePoint databases on SQL Servers you support. This session reviews SharePoint strictly from the SQL Server perspective. You will learn how SharePoint is optimized for SQL, how to properly manage and maintain the SharePoint databases, how to optimize the SQL configuration for SharePoint,  what settings in SharePoint need to be changed or not changed to maintain SQL Server performance, supported methods for providing high availability and disaster recovery, and the part SharePoint and SQL each play in the Microsoft Business Intelligence story.</p>

<h3>SQL Server PDW 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Although many have still not heard much about Microsoft's Parallel Data Warehouse Appliance the 2012 release of the product is our 7th version to market.  I will cover the basic differences between SMP and MPP data warehouse systems, how the Microsoft PDW works, and what features and sizes are available in PDW 2012.   We'll also talk about how PDW 2012 allows you to integrate your typical relational data with your Big Data in one integrated environment.

<h3>Database Change Management</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For too long have database developers had to suffer with inferior tools and processes! Database development is just as important as application development and it deserves equivalent tooling.

<h3>AlwaysOn, Clustering, Mirroring:  What are they?  What aren't they"</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We hear these names bandied about, but what exactly are they?  How do they benefit the end user?  How do they differ?  What problems do they solve?  How does a DBA implement them?
We will address these technologies showing what they do.  We'll describe the typical situations where they are used.  We'll list the major costs associated with each.  We'll give bullet points that can help management decide whether to implement a given option.</p>

<h3>Yesterday I Couldn’t Even Spell ‘DBA’.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Referred to as “DBA by Default” or “Reluctant DBA”, many people are faced with the situation of suddenly becoming a SQL Server database administrator.  Once the initial shock passes they realize that they need help. The abundance of SQL Server books and websites that exist, some good and some not so good, might only increase confusion leading to panic and rash decisions. DON’T PANIC! In this session we will cover ways to address basic problems and offer some suggestions for finding good places to find help. </p>
