<h3>Take P, R or U and Solve your Data Quality Problems</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today we deal with more and more data. Unfortunately our data quality problems we had in the past are still not really solved. Ok, we have tools like Master Data Services (MDS) and Data Quality Services (DQS), but they are not enough, if you work with large, complex data streams and if you need to operationalize your data curation processes. Here, two languages usable with SQL Server 2017, Python and R, can help you. Also Azure Datalake Analytics (ADLA) has possibilities that you can use. 
In a demo driven presentation, we show what libraries you can use to build score matrices, to build standardization processes, to do deduplication in ADLA or to build a Data Quality Dashboard in Power BI. There are a lot of fantastic functionalities in the Microsoft Data Platform to curate data. You need just to know how...</p>

<h3>Hardening SQL Server in a legacy environment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have a lot of legacy applications using your SQL servers? Do you still have to run older versions of SQL server, because the app vendors are slow to upgrade? Are you rightfully worried that one day, you too will suffer a malicious attack on your precious data?

This session covers the essentials on starting to harden your SQL servers so they can have a much better chance of withstanding attacks - such as the currently popular Ransom Ware wave.

We will be looking at the basic strategies of keeping your backups truly safe, how to successfully monitor for anomalies, and also how to incrementally implement basic in transit encryption (IPSEC).</p>

<h3>Magical Memory Moments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>OR, How In-Memory Objects Can Supercharge Your Data And Bring About World Peace 

OK, so you’ve been reading about, perhaps even testing out some of the ‘in-memory’ objects now available in SQL Server. Some of the claims are exciting, and some seem overly optimistic. And Yet, you want to know, experience more … Perhaps your situation doesn’t really call out for in-memory tables. But you should consider memory-optimized #Temp tables, memory-optimized table variables, and natively compiled stored procedures.It’s true. Using memory-optimized tables requires a little more fore-thought, a bit more care, even a few configuration tweaks.
• But what are the real advantages of memory-optimized objects?
• What are the memory-optimized objects you can use?
• How can you best use memory-optimized objects?
In this demo packed session, we will discuss the pros and cons of using memory-optimized objects in ways that will supercharge your SQL Server.</p>

<h3>When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we would not need any error handling, because there would be no errors. But in the real world we need to have error handling in our stored procedures. Error handling in SQL Server is a most confusing topic, because there are such great inconsistencies. But that does not mean that we as database developers can hide our head in the sand.

This presentation starts with a horror show of the many different actions SQL Server can take in case of an error. We will then learn how should deal with this - what we should do and what we should not and that with SET XACT_ABORT we get better consistency. We will learn how TRY-CATCH works in SQL Server, and we will get a recipe for how to write CATCH blocks. More generally, we will learn why it pays off to be simple-minded to survive in this maze. The session mainly looks at traditional T-SQL code, but the session ends with a quick look at natively compiled stored procedures, where everything is different.</p>

<h3>DevOPs and the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.

In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running database hosted in Azure the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.</p>

<h3>The Nine Realms of Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Planning a Power BI solution and want to understand your options and choices?  There is much to consider as you discover your data super powers.  Like the old story of the Four Blind Men and The Elephant, if you ask four people to describe Power BI; you are likely to get four different answers.  Power BI makes it easy to get started but things can get complicated quickly.  Should you import your data and use the cloud service?; or keep your data on-premises using the gateway?  Should you use DirectQuery or direct access to Analysis Services, multidimensional or tabular, in Azure or on-prem?  What is the best method to secure data and control user access?  How will users access dashboards  reports?  Can it be embedded?  How do you license all this?  Where do we start and how do we get there?  
From simple desktop and published reports, to enterprise-scale and highly-secured solutions; I will distill all these options into categories and provide a roadmap to conquer each realm; from Mi</p>

<h3>Modernizing your legacy database integration points</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Legacy corporate applications that are built in-house can quite often be tightly coupled together. Either you have cross database connections, load jobs, linked servers, multiple copies of data, etc. These design patterns increase your technical debt and application changes will need to carefully consider the impact to the downstream applications. Tightly coupled databases can also make migration/upgrade projects more difficult, especially as you start to looking towards cloud based solutions.   
 
What if your organization has started to implement newer design patterns and technologies like microservices, restful web integration or enterprise service buses? Do you have to re-write all of your legacy applications to use these new technologies? 
This presentation will show a method that was used to update legacy applications to utilize an integration middleware platform without a major re-write of the application. We will then expand on this and show how your SQL Server database could</p>

<h3>100 Percent Online Schema Migrations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>High availability is an important goal, not just for the database but for all software services. There's increasing pressure to keep those services online 24/7/365. But there's also pressure to deploy improvements frequently. How can developers change the database schema without interrupting the availability?

In this session, I introduce and describe the "blue-green" continuous delivery technique - a strategy for replacing system components without down time. I explain what it looks like for database changes without sacrificing availability or performance.

I'll also describe how we gradually modified our process in baby steps. Going from maintenance window deployments to fully online deployments.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Cortana  – Turning Data into Intelligent Action</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>According to the Economist magazine, data is the world’s most valuable resource.  So, it makes sense that Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals, we need to know how these core pieces will affect what we do, and how we can use this suite to help our clients.  Microsoft’s Cortana suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  Using an easy to follow example, I will show the flow from Data to Data Intelligence. The demonstration uses several pieces of the Cortana Suite and brings them together to show how they complement each other.  This overview of Cortana Suite will use the various pieces like a puzzle which, when brought together, will form a seamless picture of the whole so that participants can see that the individual pieces were meant to work together.</p>

<h3>Columnstore Introductional Session</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The world of Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence has changed drastically over the last years, with the introduction of the Columnstore Indexes,
by the most Database Providers (Relational and Non-Relational). This new type of the Indexes (Columnstore) and the way of working with data (Batch Mode),
allows to improve performance of the massive workloads in 10s of times.
Microsoft has introduced the Columnstore Indexes for the relational engines in their appliance Parallel Data Warehouse, and in SQL Server 2012 the first version became available for the general database market. Since that version, a huge number of changes has been made to ensure the capacity and the performance of the Columnstore Indexes would be on the top.
In this introduction session I will show how the Columnstore Indexes achieve this performance, what are their essential internal elements and how can you get the best performance out of them.</p>

<h3>Microservice-Pattern using Serverless-Architectur (Azure Functions)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today there are microservices and all shapes and colors and one of the most favorite implementation of this pattern is by leveraging a containerized-architecture. There are many companies doing it already and there are a zillion blogs and online resources for this.
But since microservice is a pattern, it can actually be implemented using different architectures, like the serverless-architecture.
In this Session we’ll see how to implement this pattern using Azure Functions, Microsoft’s implementation of the serverless-architecture.</p>
