<h3>SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.</p>

<h3>The SQL Career Roadmap for Women (and Men)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The ideal way to become a SQL Server professional is to get a degree, get a junior position, and then work your way up. But, the vast majority of data professionals don’t follow this path! Instead, most of us start out as “accidental DBAs” and fumble our way into a full time data career.
This is not ideal, and we could all use some help navigating through resumes, job hunting, interviews, and negotiating.
You’ll learn about all that in this session. We will also talk about how to get around a big obstacle for both women and men: how to get back to work after a long period of not working.
How can I get a database job with no experience? What’s the best way to learn the newest technology? What resources are out there? Bring your questions, and we’ll explore the answers.</p>

<h3>Advanced T-SQL Development with latest features.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the last releases,  SQL Server development was enriched with new T-SQL features, such as CTE (common table extension), array of Ranking and Windowing functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, TILE), MERGE statement, OUTPUT clause, EXCEPT and INTERSECT just to name a few. For various reasons some DBA/Developers do not utilize these new features.

<h3>Make Database Documentation your Minion</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most IT folks aren’t a fan of writing documentation. We are far more interested in creating solutions, solving problems, and making things go faster, than in documenting how we did it. 
But, Future Us will need to know what Today Us meant with this procedure’s parameters, and what that job is even for. Coworkers will thank us for explaining choices made for design, development, and admin. How can we do this without a big Word document?
T-SQL comments are simple and natural to create, and can reduce your future troubleshooting time by ten times or more!
In this session you’ll learn innovative options for documenting using comments, like using expanded flower boxes, headers, “extended commenting” (also known as help systems), and more. We’ll also talk about the options available for non-comment-able objects: tables, SSIS packages, and SSRS reports.
Documenting via comments serves YOU. They’re your repository of tribal knowledge, your exobrain, and your minion. Come learn all about it</p>

<h3>Managing Excel Power Query With VBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this demo-rich session, we will show how VBA can be utilised to create and manage Power Query queries within Excel, using Excel functionality and external files, all without using Power Query directly. The Power Query UI is used to validate that queries and functions are bona-fide.
We start by building a query from within Excel VBA to demonstrate the capability and functionality available to the developer. Then we will show how to manage a library of Power Query functions using this VBA technique, demonstrating the usage of one of these functions. Time permitting, we will go on to show how we can extend this technique, taking a multi-company dataset and splitting it into multiple queries, building a template query that can be used to create the multiple queries. All of this will be done without using the Power Query UI, nor even opening Power Query.
It is assumed that delegates will be familiar with VBA and Power Query, using the Power Query UI, basic M, and Power Query functions.</p>

<h3>Adopting a Compliant Database DevOps Process</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Presented by Redgate 

DevOps is transforming software development, with many organizations and individuals adopting lean development practices, implementing Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and performing on-demand deployments to their production environments. However, the database is largely ignored and seen as a bottleneck for a DevOps software development process. We will discuss the challenges of database development and deployment and examine why many developers find the database to be an impediment. We examine the risks of sensitive data in the development process and how you can ensure that data security concerns do not get in the way of the need for speed and agility. We’ll look at how you can adopt a Compliant Database DevOps approach that removes the database bottleneck while ensuring compliance with regulations governing the use of data within your organization such as GDPR, HIPPA or SOX.  We’ll discuss the techniques used to include the data</p>

<h3>Your SQL Servers are Mi$ConFiguReDed</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Your SQL Servers are misconfigured!

And it is probably not your fault.

90% of the SQL Servers I have seen in my 18 year career are just wrong. Not “crash” or “won’t start” wrong. More like “why is the website so slow” wrong.
 

We are going to roll through a clean install and look at some things that can be made right during the install. And then we will look at some configurations that can only be done after the install.

Things like:
·        Instant File Initialization
·        Backup Compression
·        MAXDOP
·        TempDB configuration
·        Cost Threshold for Parallelism
·        And more if we have time!

Fair warning…I’m going to overuse the phrase “It Depends”

Dallas DBAs is dedicated to helping you find these issues, test them, remediate them and get the most stability, reliability and performance out of your SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  I have stored in Azure Data Lake Store several gigabytes of US Census data at a reasonable rate per month.  Now I can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.</p>

<p>How often when creating a new table you just made the Clustered Index using an Integer column with Identity properties.  Seems like that is all I have done for last many years.  But, in the last two years I’ve really dove into indexes and finally with this presentation looked at what really makes a good Clustered Index with benchmarks and varying scenarios.  In some scenarios a well-defined clustered index may out perform a covering non-clustered index.  Results are very interesting and may surprise you.</p>

<h3>Managing the mystery database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As database administrators, we often are responsible for managing large amounts of databases so it can be difficult to understand who or what is using each of them and why. Yet we are responsible for making sure these databases are backed up, secure and cared for. As well as, we are responsible for leading projects such as upgrades and migrations where this information becomes relevant. If application owners and documentation exist, we can certainly utilize that, but what if it doesn’t or information is limited. This session will look at tips and tricks you can do to figure out what these mystery databases are so you can make better decisions on them. 

By figuring out what these mystery databases, you will be more equipped to make decisions on things several items such as the following: 
•	Decommissions
•	Lower resource allocation and costs (especially for storage)
•	Better planning for database migrations
•	Troubleshoot connection issues
•	Better planning for SQL upgrades</p>

<h3>Annoyed with a stubborn pivot table? PowerPivot is your answer.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is for you if you’ve ever built an amazing data set that was everything you needed, but then you went to create a dashboard, you got annoyed by any of the following:

-Your boss won’t approve the costs to get PowerBI Desktop.
-You’re not a coder, so learning R or Python sounds super scary
-You add a whole bunch of columns to your data set and now your file size is gargantuan 
-You add a field to a pivot table and the grand total row makes no reasonable sense
-Your average between two dates is 2.6166666667; how many hours and minutes is that?
-You add a date field to a pivot table and the month names get sorted alphabetically
-You add a graph to your dashboard, but have to add a table that will be hidden from a user later
-The two new pivot tables make your dashboard looks out of whack

Providing an overview of the above, the demos will give an insight into how powerful PowerPivot, PowerBI, and DAX can be.  I'll provide cool tricks and new ideas on what to search</p>

– Dynamically create multiple SISS packages for a data warehouse ETL load, each following a different best practice design pattern.
– Automatically execute each package multiple times and record the results for analysis.
– Determine which package version should be used in production.
The only way to be sure that your SSIS packages are performing optimally is to test them against multiple patterns. Make your life easier and let BimlScript do the work for you.</p>

<h3>Using Oracle GoldenGate to Replicate SQL Server Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Some people think of Oracle and SQL Server as mutually exclusive. In my experience many SQL Server customers use Oracle products to enhance their SQL Server databases because of replication challenges as well as enhanced security. Some of Oracle’s products, such as Oracle GoldenGate, Oracle GoldenGate Veridata, Database Firewall and Audit Vault can greatly enhance Microsoft SQL Server.

This presentation covers the basics of what Oracle GoldenGate is, how it works with Microsoft SQL
Server and a few case studies on how it has enhanced some large SQL Server installations. GoldenGate is a heterogeneous replication project. It can be used to migrate data between various databases as well as different versions of the same database product. It can be used for database upgrades and migrations, loading data warehouses and data lakes and a number of other purposes.
This presentation will introduce you to Oracle GoldenGate, its uses and how to use it.</p>

<h3>Azure Databricks (ADB) and the Traditional DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As more data services come online in Microsoft Azure, DBAs are being tasked with bringing these services into their organizations.  Azure Databricks is one such service that has the appeal of combining scalable compute resources with collaborative development and analytic tools in Notebooks and workspaces.  To the traditional DBA, however, many of the concepts and language support may be foreign. What the heck is Scala anyway?  This session is designed to introduce the DBA to the Azure Databricks workspace and show how to easily integrate it with upstream and downstream services like Azure Data Factory and Machine Learning.</p>

<h3>PowerShell for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.</p>

<h3>Scales, Measurements and Encoding Schemes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Programmers have learned how to design programs, but they haven't really thought about how to design data. First normal form requires that the columns in a table be scalar values. But how many database people actually know what a scale is or have any background in measurement theory? Likewise, how many people invent encoding schemes by simply numbering a list of values? This session should make you into a better database programmer.</p>

He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.</p>
