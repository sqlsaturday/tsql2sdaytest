<h3>Better Decision Making with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For most organizations, business intelligence means requesting reports from IT. The IT people then go into the company’s databases to find the requested information and deliver it. If the decision-makers want the data displayed in a certain way, they have to specify it in their requests—or, as often as not, they have to return to the IT office to make another request when they realize they need the data presented differently. But Power BI is what’s called self-service business intelligence. That means for most purposes non-technical users will be able to crunch the numbers without any help from IT. And switching to different graphics and displays is so easy the main difficulty is deciding which one to use.</p>

<h3>Building Perfect SQL Servers, Every Time</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Some of the biggest challenges in any large SQL environment are maintaining consistent configurations and meeting the pressures from the business for rapid server deployments. Join us in this session to learn best practices for system settings, file system layout, and scheduling maintenance tasks. 

By default, SQL Server does not install with best practices for every environment. In this session, we will discuss the best practices for most SQL Server configurations, and how to automate your SQL Server builds in both physical and virtual worlds. As you may know, completely automating the build process has great benefits, but it also has great trade-offs. We will talk about lessons learned from building a private cloud at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company with thousands of servers. 

You will also learn how use these same methods to ensure your own server build consistency, whether your SQL Servers are in the cloud or on-premises.</p>

<h3>Women in Tech Panel</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%.    Attend this WIT session with panelists Erin Stellato, Malathi Mahadevan, Ginger Grant, Tamera Clark, Meredith Ryan, and Kathi Kellenberger to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life. To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you complete The Confidence Quiz (http://theconfidencecode.com/confidence-quiz/) before the event and print out the results and recommendation. NOTE: You will not be required to share your results with the other participants during the sessi</p>

<h3>Making the Leap from Profiler to Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve been using SQL Trace and Profiler since you started using SQL Server.  They’re like old friends, tried and true.  You know how they work, you know what you can capture, you know how to find the data you need.  But now you’ve been told that your good friends have been deprecated in SQL Server 2012, and you need to become best friends with Extended Events.  What is THAT all about?  It’s ok.  Really.  In this session we’ll look at Profiler and Extended Events side by side to see how easy it is to transition to Extended Events.  We’ll step through real world examples using Extended Events to do what you’re used to doing with Trace, and even more.  You can find the time learn Extended Events…today.</p>

<h3>Why Re-Invent the Wheel?  Build One Solution to Import/ Export Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most of the projects I work on or have worked on begin with importing some type of data or end with exporting some type of data or both.  Why do we continue to build solutions that include the importing or exporting of data?  Why have we not taken a practical look at how we solve problems in SQL Server and build our own tools to solve repetitive issues?  In this session you will learn some of the practical solutions I’ve implemented so that I never have to build a SSIS package that imports data to enable me to do the real work on the data; I get to do the fun stuff to the data right away because my import process has already been written, the data has been parsed and validated, and I have my data in a form that I can work with immediately.  I will demonstrate database design (tables, indexes, etc.), SSIS packages, stored procedures, views, and Columnstore Indexes to process data quickly.  Also, I will show a Visual Studio MVC Web application used to manage the solution.</p>

<h3>Getting Started With Execution Plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you just breaking into the query tuning side of managing your SQL Servers?  In this session, we will cover the basics you need to start leveraging execution plans as part of your tuning process.  We will discuss how SQL Server creates and uses plans, and how to collect them.  Once we have the plans, we will go step-by-step through how to read them, and what the most common operators mean.  We will look at the different types of operators not just from a standpoint of what they do, but how they can impact query performance.  We will also cover how good database design and maintenance allow you to get better execution plans through having the right indexes and up-to-date statistics.

<h3>Every Byte Counts: Why Your Data Type Choices Matter</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns?  Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why?  Did you know that these Datatype Choices can be a real performance killer?

<h3>The Lost Science of Set Theory</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.).

This session will teach you how to get great performance, avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world. </p>

<h3>What SQL DBAs need to know about SharePoint</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the number of deployments of SharePoint exponentially growing every day, as a DBA, it is very likely you are going to have SharePoint databases on SQL Servers you support. This session reviews SharePoint strictly from the SQL Server perspective. You will learn how SharePoint is optimized for SQL, how to properly manage and maintain the SharePoint databases, how to optimize the SQL configuration for SharePoint, what settings in SharePoint need to be changed or not changed to maintain SQL Server performance, and supported methods for providing high availability and disaster recovery.</p>

<h3>DBA 911 - Database Corruption</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption.  In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands, monitoring for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when to restore versus repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for corruption, identify different types of corruption, and take the appropriate measures for dealing with it.
