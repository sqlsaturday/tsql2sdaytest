<h3>Understanding Storage Systems and SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The most important part of your SQL Server is also the slowest, Storage. This talk will take you through the fundamentals of your server's Disk I/O System. This session should give you a solid foundation over storage systems and help you understand why they are slow and how to overcome some of their limitations. We will cover the basics of computer systems, hard disks and disk controllers. Next, we will move to the fundamentals of RAID and how to configure your arrays for performance and reliability. Later, we will discuss the relationship between SQL Server and the file system, what is required for SQL Server and how to configure the file system for optimal performance. Finally, we will touch on how to monitor the performance and health of</p>

<h3>Making Heads or Tails of Analysis Services Storage</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How can you make your cube more real-time? How can you get more out of your enterprise data warehouse by putting Analysis Services on top of it? What’s new in Denali for Analysis Services? In this session we will take a deep dive into storage modes in Analysis Services. We’ll discuss the pros and cons of the two storage modes a Multidimensional model can use: MOLAP and ROLAP. We’ll discuss the storage modes in new Tabular models coming in the next version of Analysis Services: Vertipaq and DirectQuery. We’ll preview the new columnar index in the next version of SQL Server and discuss how it impacts Analysis Services. And we’ll discuss why one Fortune 500 company chose ROLAP and another chose MOLAP.</p>

<h3>Unraveling Tangled Code – A Spellbinding Tale</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. Query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!</p>

<h3>The Backup Tune-up</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever gotten tired of your 1TB database taking 4+ hrs to backup? Are you sick of having your users breathe down your neck for 2hrs because it’s taking too long to restore a DB? Well now you don’t have to worry about that anymore. I’m going to show you some little known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would a query. Backups actually have kind of an execution plan that you can access if you know how, and knowing how to get the individual portions of your backup process down will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. I’m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method I’ve used for 15yrs to tune my backups and I’ve had great success wi

<h3>ETL Head-to-Head: T-SQL vs. SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we'll compare ETL strategies between SQL Server Integration Services and plain old T-SQL. Is one better than the other? Should I just use SSIS and skip T-SQL altogether, or vice versa? We'll address these questions and more, and will take a look at some practical examples and a few head-to-head comparisons using both tools. 
Seesion Goals: 
•Attendees will gain an understanding of the role of Transact-SQL as part of an ETL strategy. 
•Attendees will gain an understanding of the logistical differences between using SSIS and Transact-SQL for ETL processing. 
•Attendees will learn, through practical demonstration, some situations that may be better served by Transact-SQL rather than SSIS (and the reverse).  </p>

<h3>How to use the XML Datasource in SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>XML is a convenient method for transferring data from system to system.  SQL Server SSIS provides the XML Datasource to import this data into SQL Server.  In this session we will learn how to set up a simple XML Datasource.  Then we will look at handling XML files with a more hierarchical structure.</p>

<h3>Serene Velocity: Reporting Services and SSAS Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSRS 2008 R2 provides powerful capabilities to help us develop sophisticated reports from Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. Unfortunately, many of these features, such as the server aggregation function, are commonly ignored by report developers. The result: redundant work in the reporting layer. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson exposes ways to optimize reporting from SSAS by writing MDX that leverages, rather than replicates, what the cube is designed to do best.</p>

<h3>Governing  Your Database Environment </h3>

<h3>Stored procedure tracing using the xml datatype </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When running a stored procedure it is difficult to record what is happening. I developed a simple logging mechanism.  In this session we will examine logger code in T-SQL I added to a stored procedure. We will use the xml datatype to record parameter values, variable values and debug statements. We will look at the "For xml" statement as well as the xml datatype methods, especially the modify method.  Finally we will look at how to read the logs when finished.</p>

<h3>What's so special about PL/SQL in 30 Minutes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>AKA, things I'd like to see in MS SQL Server.  PL/SQL is a powerful and flexible SQL programming language that supports some nice features.  This is a good overview of people that have to stray across the great divide into “Oracle world”.</p>

<h3>BI Drive By: A Quick Tour of SQL Server BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we'll take a very fast tour through the major components of SQL Server Business Intelligence (Integration Services, Analysis Services, Reporting Services).  We'll discuss the roles of each of these tools in the enterprise, briefly reviewing some practical applications of each.  This session is ideal for software developers, business principals, or other technical professionals who have had little to no exposure to the SQL Server BI stack.</p>

<h3>Building Secure Applications with SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As recent breaches and disruptions have demonstrated, application security could not be more critical. As the foundation of many of our applications and the stores of our most sensitive data, databases are a prime target. Still, very few developers take advantage of security features available to them to secure the databases behind their applications. Join Bryan Smith, a Database Technical Specialist with Microsoft, in exploring security features and best practices applicable to Microsoft SQL Server which will allow you to secure your database applications.</p>

<h3>EntityFramework 360:  CodeOnly 4.1</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Come see the new "code-centric" approach to managing your application data. In this session, we’ll • Explore the Entity Framework 4.1, its components and show how it works • Define an object model, implementing persistent POCO classes, while customizing the mapping via the tool's fluent API • Walk through a variety of examples that show how to interact with the model • Demonstrate how the Entity Framework automatically tracks data changes and generates updates. You’ll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the new “code only” extensions enable you to implement a code-centric approach to store persistence.</p>

<h3>SQL Server TDE in 30 Minutes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up?  This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology.  This is a topic that is an Enterprise Feature, but allows you to have your database encrypted on disk.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy as well as how it relates to SQL Server TDE.</p>
