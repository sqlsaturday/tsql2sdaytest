<h3>Querying NoSQL with SQL: HAVING Your JSON Cake and SELECTing it too</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Until recently, agile business had to choose between the benefits of JSON-based NoSQL databases and the benefits of SQL-based querying. NoSQL provides schema flexibility, high performance, and elastic scaling, while SQL provides expressive, independent data access. Recent convergence allows developers and organizations to have the best of both worlds.

Developers need to deliver apps that readily evolve, perform, and scale, all to match changing business needs. Organizations need rapid access to their operational data, using standard analytical tools, for insight into their business. In this session, you will learn the ways that SQL can be applied to NoSQL databases, and what additional features are needed to deal with JSON documents. SQL for JSON, JSON data modeling, indexing, and tool integration will be covered. This session will focus mainly on CosmosDb and Couchbase, but it will also touch on emerging relational approaches to JSON data.</p>

<h3>Using Open Source Software to Collect Performance Metrics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions. 

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store to track what queries are running. Then, we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive and easy to set up system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances, Azure Managed Instances, and Azure SQL Databases. Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize it interactively, and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issues. Finally, we will look at a problem I solved using this solution as an example.</p>

<h3>Azure SQL Database: Maximizing Cloud Performance and Availability</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When you move to Azure SQL Database, you select a predefined set of allocated resources across several dimensions such as CPU, memory, storage, and more. For a typical business application you need to find a balance between cost, performance demands and availability requirements. Yet for your mission critical application your focus moves toward the highest availability (i.e. 99.995% uptime) and performance. In this session we’ll review best practices around how to select your Azure SQL database configuration that is optimized for a specific application pattern and how to maximize its performance and availability.  We’ll review the natural advantages you can leverage from the Azure SQL Database ecosystem and detail factors to consider when optimizing for performance in the cloud, including application patterns and anti-patterns that you may encounter when migrating legacy applications from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.</p>

<h3>Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When it comes to getting your data into Excel or Power BI, M is your best choice. The M Language (A.K.A Power Query) is a powerful tool for self-service data preparation. However, it's not clear where it fits compared to tools like SSIS or TSQL. It's also not clear what it's limitations are. This session will cover the basics of M and when to use it.

In this session, we'll demonstrate how M is a linear series of transformations, just like a set of steps from a recipe. We'll show how 80% of what you will ever need to do can be done from the GUI. We'll also talk about how to write custom code for that other 20%. By the end of this presentation, you'll be able to take any manual cleanup you do today and turn it into a repeatable process with M.</p>

<h3>Getting started with Azure SQL Database: What You Need To Know!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure SQL Database offers a way quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore. In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible. By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily.

<h3>More Common Than You Think: Mental Illness in Tech</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Mental illness is more common than you think.  One in four Americans suffers from a mental illness each year.  In the tech community, this is often not talked about.  Many times, people feel alone and isolated in the tech community with us mostly being introverted people.  It is time to start talking about mental illness out in the open and honestly about how it affects us and those around us.

In this session, we will talk about what mental illness is and what it is not.  How my mental illness has affected me.  How it effects the tech industry.  How mental illness can affect you and how you can tell if you are starting to have issues.  What to say and what not to say to people you know that are affected by mental illness.  Finally, how to get help and where reach out for help.</p>

<h3>AWS vs. Azure: What's The Difference For A DBA?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Everyone has strong opinions and reactions to which cloud database platform companies should be using but how different are they, really?  What features does one cloud provider support that the other might not?  How will normal DBA activities, such as backups and restores, change depending on the cloud provider your company uses?  Join me in this session as I share my migration stories and discuss the results of my research about how AWS and Azure are different and how many of my daily tasks and tools changed as our company migrated to AWS.  Come and listen as I share what I have learned on this journey from on-premises to the cloud.  Join me and find out which platform I would use.</p>

<h3>Navigating Today's Azure SQL Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Five years ago there was a limited number of ways to deploy and use the SQL Server engine in the Azure Cloud. Today, there are many different services that one can choose.

How do you determine which service to use?

In this presentation we focus on key attributes of your data to pick the correct service. Certain services have limits on size, performance and movability of database. Other factors, such as the budget of your project, may also come into the decision making.

Transferring a database to the cloud is usually the easiest part of the project. Scheduling batch processes, executing maintenance jobs and providing alerts is usually part of the DBA equation. For companies that have a large amount of ETL packages, a lift and shift of this code might be a consideration. Other companies are more security conscious which means auditing, compliance, and threat detection are key factors in the decision.

At the end of the presentation, the attendee will have a broad knowledge of the Azure SQL services and when to apply each to a given project.</p>

<h3>When to use indexing pro features</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using the right index for the right scenario can be the "go fast" button that keeps queries and customers happy.

Over the years, Microsoft has given us many different indexing options and flavors. Today there are many more considerations beyond "clustered or non clustered". We'll cover all those different flavor options: Filtered, Compressed, Columnstore, included columns, and Partitioning.

We'll cover an overview of what each of these options are, and then dive into some code examples to see how and when each of these work, and when the don't.

You will leave the session with a much better idea of how and when to use each of these special indexing flavors to meet your needs.</p>

<p>My career started with device support for Apple, and that's where I found my love for helping people! I then worked for Pragmatic Works supporting software, and found my love of big data. And now that SentryOne acquired Pragmatic Works software, I get to do the best of both worlds while working with a top-notch crew in the best company culture I've ever experienced.

As a Solutions Engineer, I leverage technical knowledge with consulting skills to provide advice, demonstrations and support on SQL Sentry products by being a key point of contact for existing and potential clients. I also work with development teams to provide insight into future development through testing and customer feedback, among other responsibilities.</p>
