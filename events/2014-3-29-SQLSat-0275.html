<h3>The Irish Economic Crisis, Visualized with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will explore the Irish Economic Crisis from multiple perspectives, using Microsoft’s latest Visualisation tools including Power BI, Power Query, Power Map, Power View and SharePoint”.

It starts from a very common business angle, where people need to make sense of data, fast, but don't know what questions to ask, nor how to combine available sources in a way that makes sense.

This session converts the Irish Economic crisis into a story that can be explored in an interactive way, using familiar tools, in a way that people may feel should have been noticed in the run-up to the crisis.

Come by to find out what led to a small country owing over 200 billion euro and if Power BI could have helped.

<h3>Building Your T-SQL Tool Kit: Window Function Fundamentals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you pulled a script to identify duplicates from a blog post, but couldn’t quite get it to work, because you weren’t sure what that ROW_NUMBER() function was doing. Maybe you heard talk about creating running totals without using sub-queries, but you got frustrated when the groups weren’t totaling correctly. Or maybe, you’ve never even heard of Window Functions. All are good reasons to attend this all-demo session which demystifies this versatile T-SQL tool. First, we’ll break apart the OVER clause, the key to understanding how window functions work. Then we’ll expand on each group of functions that can use the OVER clause: ranking, aggregate, and analytic functions. Finally, we’ll look at real scenarios where this tool works and talk about performance considerations. When you leave, you’ll have the fundamentals you need to fully develop your mastery of Window Functions.</p>

<h3>Analyzing I/O Subsystem Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is often I/O bound - but why? Do you feel lost when talking to your storage administrator?  Are your storage subsystems like a mysterious black box where your databases live but you can’t go visit? This session will get you up to speed with the fundamentals of storage subsystems for SQL Server. You will learn about the different types of storage that are available, and how to decide what type of storage to use for different workload types. You will also learn useful tips and techniques for configuring your storage for the best performance and reliability. We’ll cover methods to effectively measure and monitor your storage performance so that you will have valuable information and evidence available the next time you have to discuss IO performance with your storage administrator. Come to this session to learn how to analyze I/Os as well as options to reduce the bottlenecks.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2014 In-Memory OLTP / XTP Management Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You have heard about Hekaton, respectively the new Acronym XTP (eXtreme Transactional Processing) and you want to know how it works under the cover? In this session we will take a closer look at the architecture, where the performance benefits come from and how it works in detail. What kind of files is SQL Server using for transactional consistency, what happens when you delete data inside the log and inside the data files. We will see the Merge-Process and the Garbage collector in action, see how memory management works for XTP enabled databases, and thereby get an in-depth understanding of how this completely new storage engine works and how to optimize for it.</p>

<h3>Let's PowerBI Denmark with Big Data!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this fun session, we will use Microsoft's Big Data and PowerBI tools to learn about Denmark! We will mix and mashup data from a variety of sources such as 'The Spirit Level' by Prof Richard Wilkinson, UNICEF, the World Bank and even the CIA to learn more about Denmark.
BI and BA professionals need to tackle ever-increasing sources of data that are increasing in volume, velocity and variety. Let's look at fun example of global data about Denmark to look at common data storytelling by BI and BA professionals: analysing open data with varying degrees of data quality, business puzzles vs business mysteries, and deciding on which chart or graph to use when presenting data.
If the 'too much data, too little information' scenario is familiar, then come to this session, which isn't just for the international visitors who come to SQLSaturday Copenhagen every year - like myself! Uncover surprising facts as we mashup, slice and dice the data, and look at Big Data and Data Visualisation</p>

<h3>Autogenerating a process data warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In many data warehouses we model fact tables with measures based on attributes which we can count and do arithmetic upon. It is more difficult to handle fact tables with measures based on length of intervals of events happening in the source systems. So questions like "What are the typical waiting times in our order process?" are seldomly modelled in the data warehouse. Especially if the event data comes from different source systems. 

In this talk I will show you how Rehfeld has overcome this difficult problem using an autogenerated datawarehouse based on metadata on the objects in the EDW/DM layers. In this approach you can autogenerate the process data warehouse if only you have the timestamps present in the EDW layer and are able to correlate them. The talk will consist of slides and demos.</p>

<h3>High Performance Infrastructure for SQL Server 2014</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Since SQL Server 2012 a paradigm shift is occurring in how SQL Server platforms are designed and built. Come and hear why you no longer will need a SAN to create a high-available SQL Server and why I/O is no longer a problem.
In this session I will go into the new storage features in Windows Server 2012 and R2 and how they relate to SQL Server 2012 and how SQL Server 2014 expands on this.
Through working with the Core Windows Server team in Redmond during the development of Windows 8.1/R2 I did a lot of work with technologies which have been around for some time, but unavailable to Windows Server installations. We will talk about InfiniBand, Multi-path I/O, RDMA, RoCE, NAND Flash storage, latency and much more.
Being in the Data Platforms Advisors group for the SQL Server development team in Redmond, I have worked with completely new concepts of integration between SQL Server and modern hardware, many of these surfacing in SQL Server 2014

<h3>Automate your SSIS development with BIML</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever tried to import a file with the Import/Export wizard?
Or created a bunch of SSIS packages to process a data warehouse load?
Then you know how much work it is to specify the metadata correctly just to create a package that actually works.
Wouldn't it be cool if you had a descriptive language which looks at your metadata and just created the packages for you?
This is what BIML is all about. 
In this session I explain what BIML is, how it works and I'll show you how you can generate your packages and quickly respond to changes.
You can expect a demo rich session with lots of notes from the field and practical examples.
This is not just for BI developers, DBA's or SQL dev's who need to import or export data occasionally will learn some quick and easy tricks as well.

<h3>Window Functions Unleashed</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We have all been in situations where writing a GROUP BY query just didn’t do the job, or aggregation over groups required more work than could be fit into one single SQL statement. For that purpose Window functions have been around since SQL Server 2005. But it is first with SQL Server 2012 that the power of using these functions have been truly released. With the introduction of new functions and optimized performance it is now possible to implement solutions which leverage the strength in the language structure without losing performance in the result. In this demonstration packed session I will introduce the concept of Window Functions, show samples of usages and dive into the workings of the optimizer. </p>

<h3>SQL Server 2012 Memory Management</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2012 brings a wide range of changes from its previous versions - one key change is the way SQL Server memory is managed. With releases prior to SQL Server 2012, there were 2 memory managers, these have been merged into 1 with the latest version, and that’s just the start of the changes for SQL Server memory. 
This session will dive into questions related to memory primarily for SQL Server 2012. </p>

<h3>Unit testing Analysis Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Attend this session to get an overview of two different approaches to automate your testing of Analysis Services cube. The first approach captures snapshot of the cube metadata/structure and a representative sample of values from all measures. With a set of reports it is possible to compare the snapshot and find the differences - ie before and after deployment. The second approach uses the test framework nBI to test result sets, performance, syntax, structure and dimension members.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Partitioning Cubes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In every project on Business Intelligence there comes a time when the code needs to be deplyed to the production environment.
No more development, no more manual work.
But what about the partitions on the cube? Do we really need to tell and learn the DBA how to handle that on a periodic plan?
The answer is simple: No!

<h3>INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE - deep dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DML is used in  most cases without thinking about the multiple operations for the db engine. This session will give a deep dive into the internal storage engine down to record level.
After finishing the theory (and inside the theory) the differen DML commands and their tremendous operational tasks for the db engine will be investigated.
SEE, what a workload will be caused by a "forwarded record". What tremendous workload will occur in a page split. What happens if an existing record will be updated in fixed length attributes </p>

<h3>Indexing for denormalization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What has the biggest impact on SQL Server overall performance? Hardware, SQL Server configuration or maybe query tuning? No, none of those frequently discussed options. They are important, but the single, most important factor is the database design.
A third normal form is great, but sometime a database really should be denormalized to gain a performance boost. This is where indices shine. During this session you will see: how important a proper table design can be, when to use indices on computed columns and why they are way better than triggers, how to create useful indexed views and how to asses their costs and benefits.

<h3>SQL Server 2014 - New Cardinality Estimator</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In SQL Server 2014 query processing has been improved. What we can expect from new cardinality estimator? Does it really estimate better? Will our execution plans be better after migration to 2014? All of them? Is the key ascending column statistics problem solved in new version? Do we finally can have more than 200 steps in the statistics histogram per table? What about column correlation and cardinality estimates - are the predicates still completely independent?

This session will answers all these questions and will demonstrate new query processing capabilities and compare them with those from SQL Server2012.</p>

<h3>Prepare your Excel Power Pivot models for QA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The new QA function in Power BI will make it possible to ask questions to your Excel Power Pivot models and get a visualization back.

In order to give the best experience for the users of your model you need to prepare it for questions. In this session I will go through how to do this - and will also introduce the natural language syntax and thereby give you an idea of how you can help the user to get the right answer to their questions and the correct visualization as the first answer.

QA will really enable you to rock the way that users interact with data.</p>

<h3>Let's cook  'best SQL Server DBA practices'</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will go through the topics of performance, scalability and availbility - the 3 core topics that every DBA needs to know. Performance is at the core and required for every database application (small or mission-critical). In this talk we will go through the concepts, tools and procedures that will help you in monitoring and start fine-tuning the performance or find the root-cause on your data platform. The subject covered here is excerpted from my book "Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Administration cookbook". This will also be an ideal beginning for any IT person who is willing step-into DBA world. </p>

<h3>Advanced Indexing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!
Hugo will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries. Then, you will see the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes. And finally, you will get an stunning demonstration of just how bad you can hurt performance by following all those recommendations and creating too many indexes.</p>
