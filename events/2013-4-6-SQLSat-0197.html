<h3>Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.</p>

<h3>Beyond Plateaux: Optimize SSAS via Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether we inherit our Analysis Services environments from predecessors or create them - learning as we go - ourselves, we often conclude that performance (processing and / or querying) and functionality can be enhanced.  In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews ways to launch new capabilities and to propel performance beyond its current plateau, using design best practices to better meet consumer performance and functional needs.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks for Auditing in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2005 and later continued to introduce tools to help you audit what was occurring in your database, with 2012 introducing even more auditing tools.  In this session, we'll go over the questions you need to ask your business to determine what level of auditing is appropriate.  We'll go through how to set up many of the common audits to meet your business' requirements.   Each technique has its features and each has associated costs - your goal is to find a balance.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Query Plan Quality Issues</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When the query optimizer inaccurately estimates the number of rows for query execution plan iterators, performance can suffer due to the generation and use of a suboptimal plan. Fixing cardinality estimate issues will help the query optimizer generate a higher quality plan. This session will teach you how to identify cardinality estimate issues in your query execution plan and also cover various ways in which cardinality estimate issues can be addressed.</p>

BI fuss is all about?  I'll walk you through the basics of dimensional modelling to help you understand from a operational
DBA perspective what's going on and why a BI system needs to be treated differently. I'll take the mysticism out of the 
differences between OLTP and OLAP and provide a method to the maddness. </p>

<h3>Performance baseline your new SQL instance </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using freely available tools to baseline your new SQL server instance.  Using Crystal disk mark, SQLIO, Memtest86, and Dell DVDstore tools to measure, baseline and compare results of your new hardware.  Crystal disk mark and SQLIO will test IO subsystems ; memtest86 will test your memory before you put it into production.  Dell DVDstore will be used to create a database enabling you to put a synthetic load simulating numerous users to your SQL server instance, enabling the creation of solid baselines when putting the server under a heavy load.  Using the benchmarks to determine capacity of the hardware and will it met the expected load.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Jason I'm a practice lead at Redapt. I spend most of my day helping clients solve business problems mostly in the Data and Advanced Analytics spaces. Sometimes this involves various and sundry cloud technologies including Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Databricks, HDInsight and Azure SQL Database. I'm fluent in several languages including: SQL, C#, Python, and PowerShell.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Master of SQL Server (MCM) and have been recognized for my technical excellence and evangelism efforts by Microsoft by being awarded the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the last 5+ years.

In my off hours I like to snowboard, karaoke, ride roller coasters, and play arcade games</p>

<p>Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQLSaturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.
