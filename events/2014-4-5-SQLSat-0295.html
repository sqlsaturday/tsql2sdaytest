<h3>Increase your SSIS productivity with Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML language for Microsoft Business Intelligence that can take your Integration Services package development to the next level. Creating template packages added productivity to your Integration Services development effort. If the template design changes after development begins, a fair amount of rework to packages could be needed. See how Biml can help create template packages that can better adapt to changing business needs and allow for more comprehensive design or redesign. 

This session will be a demo based session that will inspire you to make Biml your number one integration services development tool. Learn how to use Biml scripts to create staging tables and integration services packages. Add metadata to your Biml scripts and really watch the possibilities expand.

<h3>Manage SQLServer Efficiently w/PowerShell Remoting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You have more and more servers to manage and less time to accomplish everything. You're writing scripts to automate those tasks but they still take time to run. PowerShell remoting allows you to manage servers without the overhead of Remote Desktop, and allows you to run processes on all your servers simultaneously.  In this session we'll walk through how PowerShell remoting works, how to set it up, and how you can save time getting things done more quickly.</p>

<h3>XPath - XQuery; I guess if I HAVE to</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I don't know anyone who likes it.  But the reality is sooner or later you'll have to use XML in your database career.  It appears in extended events, ring buffer queries, and more and more in stored procedures and columns.  Attend this session to find out what you need to know to leverage xpath, xquery, and semi-structured data in administering databases.</p>

<h3>Database Monitoring : Trying To Keep Sane</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Each of our database systems has its complexities, its idiosyncrasies, its touchy points. Digging into each of these, understanding them, baselining them and monitoring them is an essential part of a DBA's job. Doing these simple tasks in such a way that allows you to sleep at night while your systems churn away safely and gracefully is an art that we all attempt to accomplish.
We will discuss various ideas, tools, approaches, and solutions to how to monitor different pieces of our systems. Examples, code, tools, will all be shown off and shared so we can all do better. </p>

<h3>$#*! Your Database Says About Me</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Does your data sit around mocking your best attempts to support good data practices?  Databases are also bound by the GIGO rule: Garbage In is Garbage Out.  In this presentation, Karen shows you examples of the types of mistakes, misunderstandings and outright cheats that lead to poor data quality, mistrust in IT systems and overall smelliness in our IT solutions.  Using real-life evidence of her own data in your systems.</p>

<h3>Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.</p>

<h3>Integrating SQL Server with Hadoop</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Our company built a system mixing Big Data technologies (hadoop/ElasticSearch) along with SQL Server to make a system that is both highly scalable and cost effective.  In this session I’ll walk you through the ETL process of pulling data through sqoop, transforming data in hive and presenting a denormalized table in hive.  If you are looking to understand how to get data from SQL Server into hadoop and leveraging parallel architecture this is the session for you.  </p>

<h3>SQL Server TDE</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. This is a topic that is an Enterprise Feature, but allows you to have your database encrypted on disk. We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy in general as well as how it relates to SQL Server TDE.</p>

<h3>45 min to build your first SSRS report</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Does this sound like you? You were just given access to SSRS and you want to make a report. Or, you're a DBA and could use a daily report. Either way, I've got your back! You will learn everything you need to know to get that first report out the door quickly and how to tweak it once it’s deployed. We’ll even look at the differences between building a report in BIDS (Business Intelligence Development Studio) and Report Builder 3.0. We’ll use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) 2012. The query makes no difference, this time it's all about the output. </p>

<h3>Database Design: Size DOES Matter</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Great database performance starts with great database design. During the database design process it is important to select your datatypes wisely. The wrong choices will often lead to wasted space, increased response times, and less stability. Additionally you run the risk of having your design not scale as well as it should. Leave this session armed with the knowledge you need to help your databases perform at their peak efficiency. </p>

<h3>"So you have a performance issue.  What now?"</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You're a new DBA, want to be a DBA or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings.  Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  Their query or stored procedure took a very long time to run.  Can you help them?  Do you even know where to begin to help them?  Most sessions I've attended on performance tuning seem to start in the middle.  They take the approach that the audience has some understanding on how or where to start.  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow".  </p>

<h3>Managing Log File Obesity</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have your efforts to trim a few pounds off your log file been met with frustration? Are you scratching your head on why that DBCC SHRINKFILE doesn’t seem to do anything?  Log file obesity is a problem that can challenge DBAs of any level.  This session will help you deal with your overweight database by covering how log files grow, why truncating the log is a bad idea, and what you can do to keep your files trim and fit.  </p>

<h3>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

<h3>The Modern Analytics Architecture</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The traditional data warehouse has been around a long time, and it isn’t going away anytime soon. However, with other options such as Hadoop and new analytic and data mining techniques, the warehouse is no longer the center of our business analytics universe. In this session, we will cover these new platforms and our approach for integrating them into your warehouse environment.</p>

<h3>Stats Across The Stack</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Statistics are the basis of analysis. As such, almost every data tool provides statistical capabilities. In this session, you will learn to do different statistical calculations - such as correlations, regression analysis, t-tests, and chi-squared tests - in SQL, MDX, Excel, DAX, and R. You will also learn how to pick the right tool for each analytical job as we cover the strengths and weaknesses of these tools for various analytical scenarios.</p>
