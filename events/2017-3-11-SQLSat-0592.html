<h3>Architecting Availability Groups</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you a DBA familiar with some basic Windows clustering and database mirroring concepts, and now you're considering AlwaysOn Availability Groups? This session is for you! I'll cover the pros and cons of four typical configurations of AlwaysOn Availability Groups: stand-alone instances, fail-over cluster instances, multi-subnet configurations, and disaster-recovery-on-the-cheap. I'll also discuss read-only routing, and implications and limitations of the Availability Group Listener. In addition, you'll learn why you should be using Windows Server 2012 R2 or above for your Windows clusters. Join me to learn which configuration options you should choose for your Availability Group.</p>

<h3>Using Powershell to Document SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more</p>

<h3>Enterprise Machine Learning with R and SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is a pure data science and statistics scripting language. It is considered the best fit for Machine Learning. With more than 5000 packages all machine learning algorithms are covered and improving. R packages help you prepare the data, e.g.: packages for cross validation with N folds, build machine learning models, validation, create plots and to generate predictions. SQL Server 2016 and R Server are a perfect match for building enterprise grade solutions that support deployments for real time predictions and continuous model updates. Join this session for an overview based on sample cases about how to build enterprise grade machine learning solutions with SQL Server and R.</p>

<h3>The Art and Science of Designing a Mission Critical SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When asked to design a critical database solution, too many people pick an HA feature assuming it will be the right fit for the application. This can result in a costly and disappointing design that does not meet your availability goals. 
This session will show you the five basic archetypes for mission critical database systems and how to select the right features from SQL Server to implement each design. Along the way, you’ll hear some best practices, tips, and real world advice for choosing between features like Availability Groups and clustered instances of SQL Server, as well as the history of some of the more interesting and less often used availability features. You will also get a glimpse of how some of the largest mission critical systems running on the Microsoft platform are created using a distributed model where redundancy replaces failover.
While you may not be able to revisit your current designs right away, what you learn will improve how you approach designing systems.</p>

<h3>Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure SQL DB has had Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking for a while now, SQL Server 2016 brings that on-premises. But just how can you use it, what changes do you need to make to your model to get the most from it?

These new features have the potential to really improve application security, especially in compliance scenarios. Pushing the security restrictions down into the database layer has many benefits, notably only the data needed leaves the database. But there are a number of gotchas that you need to be aware of that can really mess up performance if you get them wrong.

In this session we will look at how you can get the most out of these features and retain the performance of your system.</p>

<h3>SQL Audit - Evidence Never Lies</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We've all heard about massive data breaches from big name companies. As a DBA, you should consider your company's data to be the most valuable assets. So when a data breach happens at your company, will you be able to provide management with the information? If not, then discover how SQL Server Audit can help provide you with an accurate forensic analysis of who did what to your data. In this session, we'll cover what SQL Audit can capture, how to set it up for both on-premise SQL Servers and Azure SQL Database, and finally produce reports from it.</p>

<h3>Module Signing or: How I Learned to Stop Using EXECUTE AS and Love Certificates</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Often enough we need to grant higher-level than ideal permissions to a Login or Role that are necessary to perform a task. For example, someone needs to start a SQL Agent job without being able to edit any jobs. Or, a task needs data from one of the DMVs that requires the "VIEW SERVER STATE" permission, but you don't want the user to see everything that is made available by that permission. When ownership-chaining doesn't work, the common solution is to use EXECUTE AS (i.e. Impersonation). Sometimes this works, but cross-DB tasks often require enabling cross-DB ownership chaining and/or TRUSTWORTHY, which are security risks.

Module Signing is more flexible and more secure, but requires a Certificate or Asymmetric Key. Those can be confusing to work with, and the security mechanism isn't intuitive.

Come learn how to have more secure, granular control over permissions that covers cross-DB tasks and Dynamic SQL. See what signing can do, understand how certificates work, and rejoice.</p>

<h3>From Analyst BI Day to Developer BI Night</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You are a data analyst by trade. Your SQL skills are likely used to write research queries, do quality control for the query results, and churning out reports. However, you're now concerned with loading and manipulating data in the database. You're now asked to write statements that don't start with SELECT. In short, you're becoming a SQL developer.

This session will provide you with some high-level essential resources, from additional T-SQL query operators to SQL Server Data Tools and data modeling knowledge to warehousing basics, to help you navigate this uncharted territory...coming from a speaker who has been in the same position. You will come out of the session eager to use these resources to moonlight as or transition to a developer in the SQL Server space, ideally blending this developing skill set with your analyst skill set to create a well-rounded data professional!</p>

<h3>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT and Prod is a challenge whither on premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</p>

<h3>SQL Server on Linux for SQL DBA.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For the last 25 years SQL Server DBAs administered SQL databases using only Windows GUI.
For majority of them even Windows Core is too hard to accept.
In the situation, when Microsoft invaded Linux territory with it's flagship product, as SQL DBA, you must not outsource SQL Server administration to some Linux geeks. 
You can do it yourself!
Your way!
And I show you how to do it.</p>

<h3>Tracking Change is the Backbone of Your Data Platform</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Features or concepts like Change Tracking, Change Data Capture, Temporal Tables, and other similar delta systems are complex and may carry a stigma or misapprehension in your organization around performance or security or cost. Even if you do not directly implement these features or methods absolutely, most information systems rely on tracking changes especially from legacy line of business applications. I'm here to show you robust techniques for implementing delta systems in SQL Server to increase the trustworthiness of your data warehouse. I will also steer you away from common pitfalls.</p>

<h3>Query Store – What is it all about?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL 2016 brings us many new features but one of the most anticipated is surely the Query Store. The Query Store now allows us to track query plans as they change over time giving us a whole slew of new possibilities when it comes to tuning our queries. Even just the ability to compare a previous plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. This session will give you the insight to get started using this new and wonderful feature set.</p>

<h3>Finding more space for your tight environment.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you do not have enough harddisk space and do not want buy more space, one way to get more space is compress the tables and also do some house keeping.

I am going use T-SQL script to generate script to compress each tables and release the free space by shrinking the datafiles.
And in the final I will defragment the indexes and update the statistics, since shrink datafile is not fragmentation aware task.</p>
