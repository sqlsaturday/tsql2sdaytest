<h3>Building Your First Tabular Model</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SSAS 2012 Microsoft has introduced a new BI storage engine. In addition to the traditional OLAP engine you now have the option to build your BI models on top of the new Vertipaq engine. To use the new Vertipaq engine you build a Tabular data model.  A new query language DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to query the data, create calculations, measures, and KPI’s.This session is designed to introduce you to the process of building a tabular model in SQL Server Data Tools (BIDS rebranded). We will import data from a SQL Server relational database into a tabular model project and create relationships between the tables. We will use DAX to create and manage calculations, measures, and Key Performance Indicators</p>

<h3>Full Text Indexing Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Abstract:

Today’s large data fields (LDF) are full of unstructured information stored in varchar, text, varbinary or xml data types. How do you write an 
application to search the column for patterns? Traditional SQL techniques using a column INDEX and LIKE operator result in a query plan that contains a full table scan.

I will be introducing the brother’s grimm database that has the full text of each fairy tale. I will create a full text catalog / index, select a change tracking strategy, 
define optional stop list / thesaurus file, and then populate the index. I will use CONTAINS and FREETEXT operators in SELECT queries to leverage the FTI. This resulting query plan performs index seek.

Coverage:

1 – Creating a database from scratch.
2 – Creating a table with LOB field.
3 – Loading files via BULK INSERT.
4 – Performance via traditional techniques.
5 – Creating a full text index.
6 – Performance with the full text index.
7 - What's new in SQL 2012?</p>

<h3>Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).
Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.
How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?
This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Coverage:

1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What are Federations in Azure SQL?

<h3>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</p>

<h3>Reporting Services for Mere DBAs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a DBA in the modern era, you may be required from time to time to do something outside of your comfort zone.  One of these things may be to become quickly acquainted with SSRS.  Even better is that you may be required to do things you have not considered in a standard report.  In this session, you will learn how to implement a framework to help provide a common ground for your reports.  This session will delve into fun topics such as dynamic grouping and dynamic sorting.  We are not talking about the interactive sorting that your accountant may use.  Attendees will also be introduced to a few quick methods of exporting Reports from the report server - this is from a DBA perspective after-all!</p>

<h3>Master Data Management Using MDS on SQL Server 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Master Data Services was introduced to the SQL suite starting with 2008 R2. The product is for managing "Master Data" or data that is core to the business process; the 'nouns' of the business; the 'who' and the 'what'. The 2012 version has undergone some major improvements.

In this session we'll discuss the philosophy of "Master Data Management" and how an MDS implementation is NOT a Data Warehouse, but can certainly enhance one.  We'll dive into the two popular user interface choices and options of the product to help you understand how you can get the best out of it. We'll set up a basic model during the demo and also take a peak under the covers to see some what we can touch inside the database, and what is dangerous ground.</p>

<h3>Adding Strategic Value By Leveraging Business Intelligence</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Done right, SQL Business Intelligence solutions can provide tremendous value to executives tasked with strategic decision-making. We possess massive amounts of data. By filtering it and presenting it as information, and then through analysis creating intelligence, we are ultimately able to transform our work into fact-based strategy. Using real world examples, we will demonstrate a compelling case for how IT can leverage Business Intelligence to help the organization reach its goals, and in doing so elevate IT’s own strategic role within the organization.</p>

<h3>SQL 2012 Table Compression</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</p>

<h3>DBA's Rules for Dummies... And Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In many organizations, there is a rift between DBAs and developers. The root cause is that there isn't often an established framework between what the DBAs need to manage the data and what developers need to help solve business problems. Many DBAs think that developers just write code without considering the impact to the data. And many developers think that DBA means 'Dont' Bother Asking." 

In this session for developers, veteran production DBA Mike Hillwig will help you understand the DBA's needs in order to help you bridge that gap in your organization and work better to help solve business problems. </p>

<h3>What the VLF? </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.
