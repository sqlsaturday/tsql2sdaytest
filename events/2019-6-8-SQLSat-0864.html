<h3>What's New in SQL Server 2019: 100% Demos</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You haven't installed SQL Server 2019 yet, and you don't want to sit through a bunch of slides. You want to see a series of real-world demos focusing on the features of SQL Server 2019 that will make your users happier with as little work as possible on your part. You don't have time to rewrite all your queries or learn new languages - you just want the database to go faster.

I'm Brent Ozar, and I'll give you the whirlwind tour. I'll focus on just the features that make the biggest bang for the buck, things you can implement right away and see a noticeable difference. I'll show you what kinds of code will benefit the most so you can go back to the office and have an honest discussion with management about what to expect.

No slides here - not even an about-me slide. Let's dive into some queries!</p>

<h3>Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ll find a lot of Word of Mouth (WOM) advice out there about SQL Server performance, especially
when it comes to indexes. Some of the things you have probably heard are:
 keep clustered index width small
 unique indexes perform better
 keep non-clustered index width small
 compressed indexes have fewer logical reads
 add one index for each column

But how do you know if this advice is good or bad? Did you know that there is a way to look under the hood at the actual index pages to see how the data is stored, and how it’s stored differently when data is compressed? Using this information, you can prove or disprove the WOM advice.
Attend this demo-heavy session to learn how the SQL Server optimizer uses indexes. It’s all about
performance, and the right indexes will give your application a big performance advantage.</p>

<h3>Containerize your learning - a docker introduction</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've heard about docker, but haven't found that use case for it yet or simply just don't have the time to learn it.  This session will start off showing you what docker is at a high level, and its many simple use cases.  You'll leave with enough knowledge to either use someone else's docker image or build your own.  All if this without needing to install docker on your machine. We'll go into how to spin up an environment using a cloud resource in minutes.  After that, we'll install a graphical interface for docker in a docker image to help speed up your learning.  From there, we will even spin up an SQL Server in a container that can start and stop in little to no time.</p>

<h3>Constraints are the Key (to Data Integrity)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is designed to introduce you or to re-engage your interest in all the options we have for setting constraints in a database. From datatypes to nulls to checks, defaults, foreign keys, and triggers we have a LOT of options, so it's important to know the options and also have a bit of a professional philosophy on when to use each of them - we will do a brief look at each of them. We'll talk about why getting them right on day 1 is so important, how to add them to existing tables (the syntax is the least interesting part!), and some patterns and anti-patterns you can look for when you get to the office on Monday.  Constraints aren't glamorous, but they matter, and they require an advocate - you! A good session for DBA's, developers, and yes, even managers.</p>

<h3>Azure SQL DW. Redefining MPP, how it stacks against Snowflake and RedShift</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Warehousing has been traditionally deployed via on-prem MPP solutions, and due to cloud modernization, and datacenter reduction footprint initiatives, organizations are looking out to establish a relationship with a cloud solution that can help them get off the traditional storage and compute licensing scheme, to easily scale their workloads without spending millions in newly acquired hardware, and to reduce their database administration operational tasks. 
Snowflake, RedShift and Teradata provide a path to migrate workloads into the cloud and allows a very reduced utilization expense for both compute and storage. That is at least, what the marketing says as it has a tacit disclaimer around it. 
Azure SQL Data Warehouse offers scalability, pay-as-you-go compute solutions, with data contained within the database boundaries. 
The presentation shows a side by side comparison, with pros and cons of each platform and debunks some of the myths that have surfaced.</p>

<h3>Indexing Like a Rocket Scientist</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance is what your users care about, and indexes can both improve and decrease
performance. As a SQL Developer, do you understand the difference between a clustered and
non-clustered index or what a covering index is? What is different between OLTP and data
warehouse databases when it comes to indexing?
This session is a deep dive into
 Clustered indexes
 Non-clustered indexes
 B-Tree traversal
 Primary Keys
 Covering indexes

This session will feature live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using
statistics and query plans. Understand indexing like a rocket scientist by attending this session!

Some knowledge of T-SQL and Management Studio is recommended.</p>

<h3>DevOPS for DBAs - Where is your magic wand?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DBA is key when a database platform change occurs and necessary to support the application, release processes and there is a miracle waiting to happen!

Based on my experience DBA is left out in the key element of DEVOPS, this is unfortunate. DBAs have a lot to offer . 
In this session let us overview where exactly DBAs can make miracles with their magic wand, let's talk about process and procedures. To evaluate each change request to ensure that it is well thought out, is compliant with organizational best practices. Also review what Azure DevOps is offering to manage your cloud deployments.

<h3>Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.</p>

<h3>Changing Data Is Easy, Managing Data Change is Hard!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Databases are growing.  The way we use data is changing and growing.  When you have a lot of change, it has to be managed, or bad things happen to your data and your job!  A common problem with database change management is... database change management.  This session walks the user through the concepts of database change management, why it's important, and how SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) makes this process easy.  There are a lot of great features in this frequently overlooked product, and if you are not using it, your job is a lot harder than it needs to be.  Some things we will discuss: schema compare, database versions in source control, renaming objects, and how your job is pushing the button to deliver it the EASY way with SSDT.</p>

<h3>Build a Modern Data Warehouse from disparate sources and visualize the data with PowerBI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A data warehouse (DW) is a core component of business intelligence and a central data repository for different sources. This poses many challenges as the schema definition for those sources may be completely different from one another. In this presentation, we discuss how to create a data warehouse model that can support data from multiple systems. Oscar Garcia shows how to build a dimensional model which can enable us to import the data with different shapes into a data warehouse. We then create processes to transform and load the data using Apache Spark. We finally use Power BI to visualize the data from our data warehouse and Spark.


Learning Objectives:

Challenges when using disparate data sources (different models)

Define a common model to support the different model shapes

Apache Spark Overview

Strategy for loading the different data-sets into the common model

Data analysis and visualization with Power BI</p>

<h3>What to Do When SQL Server is Unusually Slow</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>“Is something going on with the SQL Server right now?” You hear those words, and your heart starts to race a little faster. You try to connect to the SQL Server, and it responds, but you can tell it’s a little slow. You open up Activity Monitor, look at recent expensive queries, and maybe open up the Windows event logs to see if anything’s happened recently.

There’s gotta be a better way, right?

Good news – there is, and you’re about to learn how the pros do it. In one all-demo session, you’ll watch Brent Ozar use sp_WhoIsActive, sp_BlitzFirst, and sp_BlitzCache to solve several common emergencies. You’ll walk away with a written checklist to solve typical performance emergencies.</p>

<h3>How AI Saved My Great-Grandma's Cookbook</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>True Story... My great-grandmother's cookbook from 1937 was crumbling.  It had her hand-written adjustments to recipes, her own additions, and was a prized possession within our family.  Come learn how I leveraged the open-source JFK Files Project on Microsoft's GitHub (with a few modifications) to turn 150 pages of ancient cookbook into a cool searchable website.  

This session demonstrates how you can use both the built-in and custom AI in Cognitive Search. Cognitive Search ingests your data from almost any data source and enriches it using a set of cognitive skills that extracts knowledge and then lets you explore the data using Azure Search. I'll show you how to use this framework to index and search documents, photos, and hand-written text.  The public GitHub repo is available at:  https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureSearch_JFK_Files</p>

<h3>CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</p>

<h3>5 Availability Groups Issues That May Ruin Your Day</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>AlwaysOn Availability Groups have become the most common High Availability technology used with SQL Server. It provides protection at the database group level, and it stores a separate copy of each database on each node, eliminating storage from being a single point of failure.

While Availability Groups help to achieve required High Availability, they may also introduce issues in the system. In this session, Dmitri will discuss several less-known problems associated with them. You will learn how Availability Groups may impact transaction log truncation and contribute to the blocking in the system, how readable secondaries may increase CPU and I/O load on primaries among a few other things. Dmitri will also discuss how to properly setup monitoring for Availability Group infrastructure in your environment.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Windowing functions are when you add a "window" to which rows a function will look at using the OVER clause. We'll start by learning how to add the OVER clause to the commonplace COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX aggregate functions, since the OVER clause is optional. From there, we'll learn some ranking functions, which do require the OVER clause. You'll see examples that use the ROW_NUMBER function to identify and delete duplicate rows. Finally, we'll close with the RANK and DENSE_RANK functions that help you report on the grouping of your data.</p>

<p>I've been dabbling with code since the late 90's - currently working with Microsoft Business Intelligence products and Amazon Web Services. I'm also a stickler for automating as much of the day to day tasks as I can. When I'm not coding, I enjoy camping, building robots and hanging out with my family.</p>
