<h3>How Flash-Optimized Storage Accelerate Performance and Simplify Storage For Virtualized Environments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This presentation will explore the evolution of storage architectures, reviewing the technology inflection points and core business drivers that have propelled the transitions from direct attached to monolithic to modular storage solutions.  We are at the beginning of the next major technology inflection driving enterprise storage. Solid state drives (SSDs) promise to solve the performance challenges inherent in spinning disks, rendering traditional storage architectures obsolete.  But SSDs by themselves are not the solution. The next decade will be dominated by storage architectures designed from the ground up to leverage the best characteristics of flash and disk. Will these new solutions be able to simultaneously deliver high performance and high capacity primary storage? And can they improve data protection, improving recovery point and recovery time objectives with far less cost and complexity? Learn the answer and examine real-world case studies in this informative session.</p>

<h3>Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.</p>

<h3>Unit Testing SSIS Packages</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Unit testing is a widely accepted best practice, yet it is difficult to do well with SSIS packages. This session will focus on both the practice of test driven development as it applies to SSIS, and the tools for actually implementing it. It will cover in depth how to set up your development environment to support test driven development and what techniques can be used to make this practical for SSIS. You will also see how to automate the testing of SSIS packages, using the open source ssisUnit framework. The session will cover several of the common questions about automated unit testing, including how to handle test data , how to set up the environment for multiple developers, and how to make tests flexible.</p>

<h3>Intro to Common Table Expressions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Common Table Expressions (CTEs) serve two main functions: first they remove the clutter of subqueries out of the FROM clause while simultaneously making them easy to reference multiple times by alias if need be, and second they make it possible to do recursive queries. Learn the basics of using CTEs to streamline T-SQL code and to query self-referential tables.</p>

<h3>Creating an Extensible Data Quality Foundation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Quality (DQ) tools are typically expensive and difficult to integrate into your ETL and governance plans but it doesn't have to be that way. During this fun, highly-interactive session, Kevin Hazzard (Microsoft Windows Azure MVP and author of the book Metaprogramming in .NET), will show you how to implement a modular, highly resilient DQ foundation from the tools you already own, no matter which version of SQL Server you're using today. At the end of this discussion, Kevin will give you a copy of his schema and his standard DQ function library that you can use in your own databases.</p>

<h3>Writing faster queries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Poor database performance is Achilles' heel of any system. Better and faster hardware can improve systems to a certain point. However, for truly great performing systems, there is no substitute for properly written queries and designed indexes. In this session we'll take a look at some common query performance killers, along with some no so obvious things that we can do to our queries to make them as fast as possible.</p>

<h3>Query Tuning in the Clouds</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Just because you're using an Azure SQL database does not mean you can avoid tuning queries.

<h3>Getting Reports on Your Schedule</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Too often reports sent on a daily basis end up in a mail filter. Only a small percentage of the reports are actually necessary for someone to take action.
