<h3>XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.</p>

<h3>Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers</p>

<h3>A Day in the Life of a Row: Internals Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server Query Processor does a great job of hiding all the dirty work necessary to display, store, and delete data. But when it's time to tune performance, the more you know, the better decisions you will make. In this T-SQL demo-heavy deep-dive session, we'll follow the Query Processor as it rips through a database and discover the steps it takes responding to our queries.
Attend this advanced session and you will be able to: * View and interpret raw data and metadata with DMVs, XEvents, and DBCC commands, including some undocumented ones (all demo scripts included in session download) * View and describe, with precise details, exactly what data and metadata actions any given query took, and, * Attack and destroy query performance problems with some neat new weapons.

<h3>DQ What? DQ Who? DQ How?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether a company has 1 database containing 1GB of data or hundreds of databases containing terabytes or even petabytes of data, at some point they all have the same question..."What is the quality of our data?". A business runs off of it's data and if that data isn't complete, consistent, and accurate bad decision can be made. Come to this session and learn how to tell if your data is quality data worthy of making decision from. We'll learn what it means to have quality data and how you can measure the quality of your data using the Data Quality Services (DQS) component of SQL Server. Together we'll explore this lesser known part of SQL Server and learn how it works and how you can start using it to measure and improve the quality of your data and thus the decisions being made from it.</p>

<h3>What changed?  Auditing options in SQL Server 2014</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When and how was this view changed? Where did that index go? Who's accessing my sensitive data?  As a DBA, you'll face these and similar questions throughout your career.  And if you don't have an audit in place, providing answers can be difficult.

In this demo-rich session we'll examine auditing options in SQL Server 2014, including SQL Trace, event notifications, DDL and logon triggers, and SQL Server Audit.   We'll begin by defining real-world requirements for an auditing solution, such as events to capture, data to collect, output destinations, and performance considerations. As we implement each tool, we'll discuss its unique benefits and limitations, and see how it stacks up against our specifications.

By the end of this session, you'll have the knowledge you need to select and implement the auditing tool that's right for you.</p>

<h3>Goodbye Next Next Next, Hello Automated Installs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Tired of clicking through all those setup screens and entering the same information over and over again? I know I am, so I'm doing something about it...I'm automating my installs! From base SQL Server installs to Service Packs, Cumulative Updates and even Client Tools for DBA's and Developers, I'll show you ways to automate your installs using SQL Server FineBuild (CodePlex Project). Automating your installs doesn't just save you time, it improves standardization and adherence to best practices. There are multiple ways to automate your installs, but FineBuild goes above and beyond by allowing you to automate every part of the install from file locations to clusters, service accounts to custom databases, Reporting Services, Integration Services, Master Data Services, configurations and settings as well as many common 3rd party tools and more.  We'll cover many of the scenarios you may encounter and you'll walk away with some pre-built install scripts to help get you started.</p>

<h3>Hacking Expos#233; - Using SSL to Secure SQL Server Connections</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know all the ways to protect your database when it is at rest, but what about when someone connects and starts running some queries? What if they connect and don't do anything? Just how exposed is that data? 
We will assume the role of a hacker and, by using a simple technique, we will sniff packets on a network to reveal what data is being sent. You may be shocked! 
We will then secure our database connections with a simple self-signed SSL certificate. 
Once secured, we will resume the role of the hacker and look inside the packets to see what has changed. 
*Warning - Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions as actual hacking techniques are used.

<h3>Updating Statistics Affects Query Performance More Than You Think</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Stop me if you've heard this one, "This query is slow, let's update statistics." But what does updating statistics *really* do to your query performance? And is it the right solution? While updating statistics may provide a short-term solution, it can bury the true root cause. If you’re not familiar with what happens to query plans when you update statistics, then don’t miss this session. We’ll set the stage with a review of what statistics are, how the optimizer uses them, and discuss the various ways you can update them. Then we’ll explore what happens to plans when you *do* update statistics, and you’ll see why that might not always be the right long-term solution.</p>

<h3>Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.</p>

<h3>Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.</p>
