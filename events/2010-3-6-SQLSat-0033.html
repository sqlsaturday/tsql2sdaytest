<h3>PowerShell Awesomesauce</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will begin exploring the amazing world of the PowerShell language.  We will compare cmdlets/operations to similar syntax/patterns in the T-SQL language.  We'll also step through one of the most talked about topics (the foreach-object command).  PowerShell has been bragged about since the beginning because of how much you can accomplish in just one line of code.  When you leave this session YOU will be bragging about what YOU can do in just ONE line of code!</p>

<h3>Delivering BI Solutions Rapidly using Vulcan</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server, Integration Services, and Analysis Services are used together to deliver BI solutions but development efforts are carried out separately, without sharing of metadata between the products. This creates duplicate effort and compromises the ability to develop agile, iterative solutions.  Vulcan is an open source project from Microsoft (http://vulcan.codeplex.code) that helps bridge this gap, while also providing many of the benefits of code focused approaches used in application development. It allows you to define the relational data marts, ETL, and OLAP cube portions of your BI solution in a common language, and seamlessly uses that information to generate the appropriate database schemas, SSIS packages, and SSAS cubes.          </p>

<h3>As a DBA, Where do I start?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you are new to the role of DBA, being "forced" to take on the responsibility of one or are starting at a new role as a DBA, knowing where to start can often mean the difference between success or failure. In this chat, Mike will help us wade through the noise that attacks a DBA and figure out just what our priorities should be. By focusing on the "itties" of Database Administration (Recoverability, Availability - Health  Performance - , Security and Reliability) we can see a natural priority build. Throughout this interactive discussion we will also have a look at some of the available tools and scripts to help us see where our environments rate with the "itties" of Database Administration.</p>

<h3>SSIS, You, and ETL Architecture</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>BOS30-200: SSIS, You , and Better ETLDid you already learned SSIS, and now want to get serious about ETL? Did you become an SSIS developer by accident, but wonder what makes a good ETL solution? Is your current SSIS solution falling apart and you need to revamp it? The Complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poor crafted solution would inevitable lead to maintenance nightmares, or worse yet to the failure of the whole project. In this session we will try to bridge SSIS and a ETL architecture based on good practices while looking to some lessons learned from real world implementations.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Internals  Architecture</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:

-	What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems?
-	What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-	How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-	What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-	...and much more.</p>

<h3>Growing Pains - A Cautionary Tale</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It happens to everyone. One day your database is humming along quietly serving up choice nuggets of information quickly and efficiently while growing at a slow, steady rate. Then next day, your database has quadrupled in size and performance has ground to a halt as the system strains under the load. Management is screaming for answers and you're coworkers are running in circles screaming for their lives. In this session, we will examine best practices to apply to reporting databases that grow to become much larger than expected.  We will examine a real-world scenario and discuss the strategies and techniques implemented in order to get the database back on track.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Service Broker in the Real World</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting.</p>

<h3>Storage for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.</p>

<h3>Virtualize This!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the list of features of SQL Server growing constantly the need to sandbox and test drive features in a separate environment that can communicate with but not interfere with your existing environment has become vital.  With virtualization, setting up consistent test, dev, and even sandbox environments can happen minutes instead of hours AND be consistent with previous/ existing environments.  In this session we will focus on Microsoft Virtualization solutions that you can leverage starting with your desktop/laptop and extending to your server environments.  Even if you aren’t going to be doing the virtualization yourself it’s good to know what your options are.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.</p>
