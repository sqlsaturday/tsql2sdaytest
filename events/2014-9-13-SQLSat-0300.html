<h3>Analyzing I/O Subsystem Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is often I/O bound - but why? Do you feel lost when talking to your storage administrator?  Are your storage subsystems like a mysterious black box where your databases live but you can’t go visit? This session will get you up to speed with the fundamentals of storage subsystems for SQL Server. You will learn about the different types of storage that are available, and how to decide what type of storage to use for different workload types. You will also learn useful tips and techniques for configuring your storage for the best performance and reliability. We’ll cover methods to effectively measure and monitor your storage performance so that you will have valuable information and evidence available the next time you have to discuss IO performance with your storage administrator. Come to this session to learn how to analyze I/Os as well as options to reduce the bottlenecks.</p>

<h3>Outages; Dispatchers, Cops and Detectives</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Recently I watched the news as a crisis situation was played out. There were police officers were running around, moving behind large solid objects like cars, putting on their protective gear.  At first it looked like mass chaos but after watching it closely the officers moved like a well-oiled machine. 
 
The more I watched the more I realized that as database professionals we have crisis situations as well. As the situations are compared there are a number of things that we can learn by watching how other professionals handle crisis.  This session is dedicated to looking at how others handle crisis so that we can learn from what they do. </p>

<h3>Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.</p>

<h3>Increase your SSIS productivity with Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML language for Microsoft Business Intelligence that can take your Integration Services package development to the next level. Creating template packages added productivity to your Integration Services development effort. If the template design changes after development begins, a fair amount of rework to packages could be needed. See how Biml can help create template packages that can better adapt to changing business needs and allow for more comprehensive design or redesign. 

This session will be a demo based session that will inspire you to make Biml your number one integration services development tool. Learn how to use Biml scripts to create staging tables and integration services packages. Add metadata to your Biml scripts and really watch the possibilities expand.

<h3>Twice in a Lifetime: T-SQL Refactoring 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether it's because you inherited the code from the "last guy," or your stored procedures haven't been looked at since the database was created in 2001, there will come a time when you need to rewrite old code. When you start this project you may ask yourself, how did I get here? And you may ask yourself, how do I work this? This is not my beautiful database. This is not my beautiful T-SQL. Letting the data go by, information flowing to the end users is the goal. Refactoring old code can be tedious, but necessary. Sometimes it isn't just about identifying the worst queries in your application, but figuring out how to rewrite everything to introduce the best practices that the last guy didn't know about five years ago. 

This session will cover ways to quickly find old T-SQL antipatterns, tools that can help make things easier to update code, and deprecated features that can't be used in modern versions of SQL Server. Don't leave your old T-SQL the same as it ever was.</p>

<h3>Capture Change and Apply it With Change Data Capture  SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to setup a new data warehouse, keep it updated, audit changes to your databases or quickly load changes to another database Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution for all of these and can now be setup and supported easily with SQL Server  SSIS 2012! Change Data Capture (CDC) has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is setup on your databases. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Features That Will Blow Your Mind!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many lines of code does it take to generate a running total?  How would you find a value in the next row of data - without using a cursor or loop?  How can you efficiently store rows of data with a lot of optional fields, and how can you quickly find which of those rows have values?  And how can you eliminate locking without resorting to dirty reads?  SQL Server has answers for all of these questions, and none requires more than a few lines of code.  Give me an hour, and I will blow your mind!</p>

<h3>SQL Security Best Practices  Shrinking Your Attack Surface</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every industry has a governing body or standard that requires some layer of security to your data.  In my travels I have come to realize that when someone mentions security, DBA's tend to get frightened.  This could be due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or not knowing what SQL Server offers to meet those requirements.  In this session we will go over what SQL Server has to offer, Security Best Practices and how you can shrink your attack surface to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of your Servers and Data.
In addition, attending this talk is worth 1.5 Continuing Education credits.
