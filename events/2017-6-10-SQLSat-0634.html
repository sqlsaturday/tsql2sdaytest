<h3>Wish you could live the glamorous consulting life?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We are going to talk about a topic many will not touch at a SQL Saturday: Money. How to make it, how to get customers, how to market. Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).

I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.
In this session you will learn sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life. An essential session for those thinking about this choice and/or those who are just starting out. Y</p>

<h3>Performance Dreams started at SQL Server 2014 and come true now at SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>“Performance dreams  wait for you at SQL Server 2014 and Come true at SQL Server 2016 “, it is just like this because you there are unbelievable performance reads and substantial improvements that can drive your DB environment to a distinct level of stability and Performance to be a leading environment in a very short time ..! It looks like apparently a myth or legend to see those new SQL Server 2016 features how they could flipped up SQL Server Powers from the old generation to the new generation of in-advanced analytics using In-memory and CCI (Colmnstore indexes) where no longer need for any DWH solutions at all but just reading data directly from production DBs with ZERO performance impacts on end users  ..! come in here to my session and you will know more about many new features and rich powers of SQL Server 2014  2016 regarding performance particularly like  Microsoft project “Hekaton” for In-memory built in for OLTP , CCI( columnstore index) ,Resource Governor for IO consumpti</p>

<h3>Purging data in SQL 2016 using Dynamic Partitioning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have a large or potentially large database that you would like to partition?  Manually implementing table partitioning and the corresponding maintenance can be a lot of work, especially if you have many tables.  In this presentation we look at how you would implement a partitioning solution dynamically for all tables with the designated partition column.  We use a controller table so it's easy to change settings and set it up to keep a fixed number of file groups.  The partition maintenance will recycle through the file groups over time as partitions are dropped and created.  We do as much as possible through dynamic scripting.  This solution can easily be extended for archiving but in this example we are using it to implement a data retention scheme.  We look at new features in SQL 2014 such as managed lock priority and truncating partitions in SQL 2016.  Assumes you have some understanding of SQL Server table partitioning and T-SQL coding.</p>

<h3>Ethics, Morals, and Laws for the DBA 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ethics, Morals, and Laws each govern one aspect of our behavior as people and DBAs. They govern which actions we take and which actions we avoid.

Understanding the basics of these guides and how they coordinate (and sometimes conflict) with each other helps you to make choices you can live with from both a personal and professional perspective.

This session presents basic definitions, ideas, and discussion points. It is intended to be an interactive presentation where the audience contributes to the discussion, so no two presentations are exactly the same!</p>

<h3>Master Data Management with SQL Server 2016 MDS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>

<h3>Learn to Love Database Security Audits</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Configuring the security on a SQL Server instance is often treated like a one-time event, but nothing could be further from the truth.  DBAs need to proactively watch each and every piece of the security infrastructure to ensure that the security we have implemented is effective and up-to-date.  But that’s a huge task in itself.  Where do we begin?

In this session, we’ll talk about why auditing is probably the single most important piece of the security infrastructure, and where to find security-related information in SQL Server’s metadata and logs.  I’ll also demonstrate how to distill the vast amount of metadata available into reports and alerts that are manageable, meaningful, and actionable.</p>

<h3>He's Assertive, She's Aggressive: Recognizing patterns of unconscious bias in the workplace</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Social science has shown that people tend classify one another by gender, race, or other physical characteristics and instinctively react based on stereotypes and cultural norms.  These automatic prejudices (often called unconscious bias) contribute to the disproportionate success of white men in STEM when compared to equally qualified women or minorities.  The difference between unconscious bias and intentional discrimination is that the people that participate in it are often motivated to end these behaviors when they're brought to their attention.

This discussion will cover some common patterns of unconscious bias that occur in the workplace and offer real, concrete actions to intervene as an employee, a manager, or an organization.</p>

<h3>Cube Processing Strategies</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There has been a wide range of Cube solutions implemented over the years.  Cube processing strategies will cover both Multidimensional and Tabular cubes.  Best practices will be included for processing large and small cubes.  Processing big cubes can consume a large amount of IO, and create lengthy response times.  Processing many small cubes at once can create bottlenecks on the database.   Additionally, processing complex cube will be addressed.  Best practices for designing dimensions and partitions will be covered in detail, because of the impact associated with good design.</p>

<h3>Joe Celko - Data Encoding Schemes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data doesn't go directly into a computer. It is usually encoded, but nobody takes time to classify and consider how to actually design these encodings. The goal of this talk is to give you those skills.

We'll begin by considering the basic types of encodings.

Enumeration Encoding
Measurement Encoding
Abbreviation Encoding
Hierarchical Encoding
Vector Encoding
Concatenation Encoding

The talk will then move on to the concepts of validation and verification, what makes a good encoding scheme, and where to look for industry standards.

Speaker: Joe Celko
Joe Celko served on the original ANSI X3H2 Database Standards committee and is the author the Joe Celko series of SQL books for Elsevier/MKP. These days, I do training and design evaluations.</p>

<h3>Supercharging Backups and Restores For Fun and Profit</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Super-fast queries are an essential part of any business process, but speed will never be more important than during a disaster when you need to restore from backup. Come and see how both backups and restores can be tuned just like a query. In this demo-intensive session, we will discuss the different phases of the backup and restore processes, how to tell how long each of them is taking, and which are the easiest to significantly speed up. You just might be surprised how simple it is to achieve dramatic results - cutting your backup and restore times by 75% or more is absolutely possible using the methods covered here.</p>
