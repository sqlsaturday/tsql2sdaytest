<h3>Implementing Data Partitioning and Tiered Storage</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Support of the large databases is not a trivial task. Large amount of data negatively impacts system performance and make administration and SLA compliance much more complicated. Data partitioning can help to solve those problems and reduce support and hardware cost. This session demonstrates various approaches of data partitioning available in SQL Server. It compares pros and cons of different partitioning techniques from performance, scalability and administration standpoints. The session also discusses how to reduce hardware cost by implementing tiered storage and demonstrates how to move data between filegroups and/or disk arrays keeping the system online in the different versions and editions of SQL Server. </p>

<h3>SQL Server encryption 3 ways - in transit, at rest and in the database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dude, where's my keys??!?!

Confused about the various ways SQL Server handles encryption? Tasked with securing your environment or trying to pass an audit? There's a lot of information that can be difficult to wade through. In this session, I'll go over three ways to encrypt SQL Server, showing practical examples of the various techniques. We'll look at encrypting the information at the network level (in transit), encrypting the data and backup files (at rest using Transparent Data Encryption) and encryption of sensitive information in the database (columns and stored procedures). 

This will be a high level, hands-on discussion that will enable any administrator to put the techniques discussed into practice immediately.  You'll see how encryption will fit into your overall security scheme.</p>

<h3>Maximizing SSIS Package Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you've developed a whiz-bang SSIS package to push around a bunch of data. You save it, run it, and.... nothing happens - or it moves verrrrry slowly. Or perhaps you've got packages that run reasonably well, but you're convinced they could run faster. Where do you start troubleshooting? How do you eliminate those performance pain points?

In this demo-packed session, we'll work through some of the most common causes of performance bottlenecks in SSIS packages, along with recommended practices for maximizing performance. Among the topics we'll cover: troubleshooting methods to detect performance hotspots; optimizing sources and destinations for maximum throughput; choosing the most efficient data flow transformations; and using parallelism to improve performance.</p>

<h3>Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.

<p>Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In the first version of this presentation we discussed organization of the DMOs - this time around we're going to get our hands dirty and see how we can use them to diagnose, tune, and get deep insight into your SQL Servers.</p>

<h3>Women In Technology Roundtable</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It has been shown many times that diverse teams create better products and develop more creative solutions to issues.  Given that why does Technology still have problems with diversity?  It seems for every article that you see highlighting a group doing good work that encourages women to consider STEM career choices, there is another that points out the issues women face inside STEM. Join a group of prominent women from data professions as we discuss the current state of WIT, and what can be done to create a more welcoming space for all.</p>
