<h3>Daily problems with indexing and its - possible - solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever been in the situation that an application performed well the last day and - suddenly - you run into problems? Although you have Index Maintenance jobs and statistics up to date you will monitor a big degrade of performance! This session will demonstrate in a over 80 percent demo based presentation the following scenarios which happend this way in real life!
- Why performance degradation in spite of maintenance jobs?
- just one more database in the result set and the query runs really bad - why?
- usage of literals is completely different from the usage of variables - why?
- identical data types but the query runs in part perfect and in part bad...
- your execution plan shows an INDEX SEEK - but the table will be scanned!
- you get a query from the business which performs really bad but when you test it it runs pretty cool - why?</p>

<h3>You don't need Enterprise Edition to do that!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The most coveted features of SQL Server are made available in Enterprise Edition and are sometimes released into Standard Edition a few years later. This often leaves a vast group of users who "window shop" the latest and greatest features and return to the office wishing they never saw those features presented. This session will show you how you can achieve the same, or at least a similar, outcome to some of those features without having to fork out for Enterprise Edition licenses or breaking any license agreements. You will leave the session with a set of solution concepts covering Partitioning, Data Compression and High Availability that you can build upon or extend and maybe save you and your company a nice pile of cash.</p>

<h3>Beginners Guide to MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Give your queries a multidimensional makeover. In this session we'll look at the structure and basics of MDX, the Multi Dimensional query eXpression language for querying Analysis Services OLAP cubes.

MDX can seem a very daunting language, but when it's broken down into the basics it's easier than you think.

We'll start at the beginning, so you need no previous MDX experience, but it does help to have some experience with cubes. If you already write MDX but struggle with the syntax, then you need to attend this session!

We'll walk through the difference between a member, measure, tuple, set and dimension. Well describe how to decipher a [] from a {} or a (), and we'll look at some of the awesome power that MDX can provide to our reporting.</p>

<h3>Real Time Power BI - API, Hubs and Streams</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI - I bet you already know what it is - also offers a nice API set that allows you to program it directly from you application so that you can push data directly to Power BI Dashboards and have them updated in real time. Or, even better, you can create a little bit more complex solution that will live in the cloud and uses Azure Event Hubs to ingest data, Stream Analytics to do some streaming query and finally Power BI to visualize it. And you can even put Azure DW in the game (and probably you should)
In this session we'll all this stuff, how it works together and how it can help us to create a very cool and useful Cloud Modern BI solution.</p>

<h3>0x010D88DDB7DFE19AAD36D - Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a principal consultant for one of the major provider of medicinal and patient data worldwide I am daily confronted with the problems encountered when dealing with patient data and sensitive information. Apart from the European legislation there are many hurdles in using and analyzing data containing information such as social security numbers, names and addresses, diagnosis and medicinal informations. SQL Server 2016 introduces Always Encrypted  which provides a clean separation between those who own the data (and can view it) and those who manage the data (but should have no access). In this session we will have a look at different setups for Always Encrypted (Hybrid solutions, pure on-premises and 100% cloud based)  as well as how to get started with it and what kind of encryption to apply. 
At the end of this session you will know about the Driver Process of Always Encrypted, how to set it up and how to deploy it and maintain it in on-premises, hybrids and cloud solutions.</p>

<h3>Business Analytics 101: Agile Analytics using Azure Machine Learning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business analytics platforms have always been tools built for statisticians and data scientists. However, these tools are increasingly being directed at business analysts, and Gartner's rankings on its well-known "completeness of vision" and "ability to execute" axes now ride as much on "ease of use" as they do on offering advanced analytical algorithms.
How does this change in landscape affect businesses? Are you new to the world of business analytics? Are you taking over an existing analytics program, or starting one from scratch? This session will help you to understand how to craft a strategy, provision the right business analytical capabilities, and move towards actionable results. We’ll identify common pitfalls to avoid as you start or reinvigorate your business analytics program. In particular, we’ll explore how companies are using self-service and data discovery techniques to deliver more agile analytics using Azure Machine Learning.</p>

<h3>Easy ETL with Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Can ETL be fun? Unfortunately, very often creation of ETL layer is time-consuming, tedious, error-prone task. What’s more, any change in requirement needs most of the work to be redone. In our session we’ll present new approach to creating BI solutions using Biml language and Mist programming environment. They greatly simplify the process, allowing for amazing flexibility, and make the ETL work more pleasant. We will show real examples of how Biml and C# generates hundreds of usable SSIS packages in just couple of minutes. We will also cover integration of ETL with TFS and CI for ETL. Everything with 100% compatibility with unmodified SQL Server. Join us and see how BI just became fun again</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2016 Query Store</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever experienced to have your system slowed down or completely down? What happens? Have you ever upgraded an application to the latest version of SQL Server and facing an issue with plan change that slows your application down? Query Plan choice change can cause these issues. SQL Server 2016, through a new feature called Query Store, let's make these problems easier to fix. Query Store retains all the execution plans used for each query; it captures the performance metrics for each plan over the time and allows you to force an execution plan easily. In this session, you will learn how the Query Store works and how it can help you to fix performance problems.</p>

<h3>Analysing application performance with pattern searching using RML Utilitie</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>RML Utilities is a tool that will allow you to normalise the queries that your application sends to the database and do some deep analysis on them. We will find out how you can find patterns like finding all queries that touch a specific table. We will use read trace and automate getting the estimated query plan against a test database for the whole trace. We can even go through the list of parameters for one query and find the selectivity based no the statistics. (this all takes place on a test db, not on production). Do you use an ORM and can't tune individual queries because you have a lot of them and they're all fast? Use my technique to find patterns and tune your application in a way you've probably not thought of before.</p>

<h3>Micro ORM - a petite beauty or a poison in a small flask?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For developers with good knowledge of SQL using a micro ORM seems like an obvious choice. But is it? In the session we will discover the features of  the micro ORM called Dapper and how can it simplify your way of communicating with the database. Then we will compare it to the Entity Framework and analyze when you should use one or the other - or neither. But wait! There is more! At the end you will see how easy it is to write a Dapper extension where the classes in your code will magically receive super SQL querying powers.</p>
