<h3>Database Backups for the Accidental DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've fallen into a job that requires you to manage a SQL Server Database Management System. Now you have to keep these databases on their feet. You've heard of this concept called a backup, and it sounds great, but you sure don't know what it is. This session is for you. We're going to go over backups, right from the beginning, so that when you come out of this session you can go back to your systems and set up backups, log backups, differentials, and anything else you might need. Further, you'll know how to recover your database in the event of an actual failure. The fundamentals you need to get a good backup in place and then be able to restore it will be covered in this session.</p>

<h3>What the VLF? </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.

<h3>Full-Text Search, it's not just for documents</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Full-text search is an often overlooked feature of SQL Server that can be used for more than searching documents. This session will cover setting up and using full-text search to handle some of those dirty data situations we've all inherited without using the dreaded "LIKE '%text%'". As an example, we will demonstrate how full-text search can be used to find names in poorly formatted data like 'mailing address' or 'billing address' fields. It will also cover how to handle noise words that may match some names and synonyms for first names to create a really robust solution that goes beyond what could be done with plain old SQL.</p>

<h3>Inroduction to Triggers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will give a brief overview of the different types of triggers available in SQL Server (DDL  DML) and then go into more detail on how and when to use DML triggers. This session will cover misconceptions about how triggers work, when triggers should and shouldn't be used (we will discuss options), common mistakes, and how to fix the most common mistakes. After attending this session a person will: 1. Identify different types of triggers and when to use them. 2. Be able to identify when a trigger is the right solution 3. Be able to write triggers that perform well </p>

<h3>Tune Queries By Fixing Bad Parameter Sniffing </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Parameter sniffing is a misunderstood issue on SQL Server. Most of the time, parameter sniffing is helping performance on your servers. But sometimes, circumstances change, and what was helping you is now hurting you – bad. In this session, we’ll gain an understanding of what exactly parameter sniffing is and why it’s usually so helpful. Then we’ll explore how parameter sniffing can go wrong and look at seven different ways you can deal with it when it does. You’ll take away a wealth of knowledge that will help you identify and resolve bad parameter sniffing in your own environment.</p>

<h3>Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.

<h3>$#*! Your Database Says About Me</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Does your data sit around mocking your best attempts to support good data practices?  Databases are also bound by the GIGO rule: Garbage In is Garbage Out.  In this presentation, Karen shows you examples of the types of mistakes, misunderstandings and outright cheats that lead to poor data quality, mistrust in IT systems and overall smelliness in our IT solutions.

<h3>Windowing Functions: THE Reason to Upgrade to 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For the first time since SQL 7 there is a compelling reason for EVERY SQL Server user to upgrade to the next version and this time around the reason is Windowing Functions.

<h3>“Indexing” Encrypted Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.</p>

<h3>Query Optimization Crash Course</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have users complaining that applications are running "too slow"?  Do your DB traces look like a short story written by monkeys at typewriters?
This is a fun, fast-paced walkthrough of the most effective strategies for query tuning.  We'll investigate the most common causes of sub-optimal queries (and some quite unusual ones) while building a foundation for solving any optimization problem that the application throws your way!</p>

<h3>Do More With Less: Consolidate and Virtualize</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In today's economic times, we are being asked to do more with less. Less budget, less hardware and yet our data needs keep growing! So how do we keep our database infrastructure humming along given these restrictions? In this session we will talk about different options of consolidation including: database-level consolidation, instance-level consolidation, and virtualization. Additionally we will also talk about some of the tools and methods you can use today to help you consolidate your SQL Server environment and do more with less!</p>

<h3>SQL Server Data Tools: Write it, test it, deploy it with Visual Studio</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is the latest iteration of technology that makes use of Visual Studio for coding, testing, and deploying databases.  SSDT provides a single solution, whether you choose to deploy your code to your own computer, to a nearby server, or to an Azure cloud database.  I'll talk about my recent "real world experiences" with this technology -- where SSDT really helped and where it ...didn't.   There will be more time for QA, so that you can better understand if this technology is right for your  projects. </p>
