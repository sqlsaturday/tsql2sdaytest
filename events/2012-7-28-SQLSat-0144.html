<h3>Business Intelligence for Managers/Decision Makers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business Intelligence is an essential component for any business today and a successful BI implementation has the power to change the way an organization functions. In this non-technical session Carlos Bossy will discuss the components of a BI project, including the data warehouse, reporting and analysis, predictive models, and the promise of Big Data.  He will show how to determine its measures of succes and ROI, the makeup of a good BI team, how to define the success of a BI implementation, and how to fix a BI project gone bad.

<h3>Mobile BI with SSRS and SharePoint</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today's executives and information workers want to use mobile devices to get at their business information, make critical decisions, and thrive. Let's help them get there with SQL Server Reporting Services and SharePoint. Tablets are common place now, and smart phones have been in place for years, but have we devoted enough attention to make effective use of the new form factors? Let's discuss how our design approach changes when we want to launch mission-critical dashboards and reports on smaller screen sizes using touch-screen technology. We'll look at iPad and other mobile devices, SSRS and SharePoint, BI Developer and Business User, with emphasis on data visualization best practices.</p>

<h3>Master Data Services in SQL Server 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A recent survey by Information Week found that data qality is the greatest barrier to BI adoption in enterprises.  MDS addresses this challenge with modelling, validation, alerting and security capabilities.  In this presentation, you will learn how to configure MDS to model your data to ensure correctness, update it with changes from your ERP, and alert users to data conditions that require attention.  You will get tips on best practices and on how to engage uses with an MDM project.  By learning this tool, and its new features in 2012, BI professionals will gain a valuable new skill that addresses the greatest risk to success for BI projects - data quality.</p>

<h3>Instant Scale, High Avail.  Performance for SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Achieving scale-out quickly and easily for MS SQL Server environments can be extremely difficult, if not impossible.  Other areas that are difficult or costly to achieve for SQL Server environments include transparent caching of Read queries, as well as instrumentation and Analytics of all SQL queries in *real-time*.  In this session, you will learn how ScaleArc has developed SQL Server infrastructure software that achieves instant scale-out, caching, load balancing, firewall/filtering and higher availability…without any changes or modifications to existing applications or SQL Server databases.  For those interested in migrating to SQL Server 2012, we will also discuss how ScaleArc can assist and add-value in a 2012 migration.</p>

<h3>Managing and Auditing SQL Server Permissions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When your boss asks you who has access to your databases, do you break out into a cold sweat? Or, instead, are you worried about those other people who might have 'sa' access to your server and might be causing trouble on your server? Either way, as DBAs we need to be able to audit our SQL Server security. This presentation will give you a general overview of the different types of roles that you can use to manage access, what they mean, and how we look at the security gremlins hiding under the covers of our databases. </p>

<h3>Stop Bad Data in its OLTP Tracks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Incorrect, inaccurate and misleading data can get into a database in a variety of ways. It causes bugs, impacts customers and hurts business. This session will explain how DBAs and developers can proactively ensure the data coming into a transactional system is clean and correct. The topics covered will include table design, the pitfalls of NULL, “garbage in”, transactions, change management, and coding standards. 

The presentation will draw on the speaker's years of personal experience managing busy e-commerce databases supporting multi-million dollar businesses. The speaker will use real-life examples and demos to illustrate the many ways that OLTP data quality can be compromised.</p>

<h3>Fuzzy-String Searching: UDF and CTE performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do you find information that was saved misspelled, or when your search is misspelled? Fuzzy-string processing! And if your information is in a database, the best place to do that processing is in the database. But there are some performance lessons to learn along the way. This session graphically illustrates the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm, and explains how it was optimized for T-SQL, using www.fuzzy-string.com and Confio Ignite.</p>

<h3>Advanced SQL Injection techniques</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL injection remains one of the most widely-used tactics used by hackers to exploit security vulnerabilities of databases in order to get at sensitive information or to gain further system access to wreak havoc with more attacks. Though the majority of SQL injections are fairly simple and familiar, the more advanced ones can evade detection by some conventional security measures. I will offer up an in-depth analysis of some sophisticated SQL injection hacks and attacks, and offer up some best practices on how to harden your applications and databases against them in order to keep business-critical information safe.</p>

<h3>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
