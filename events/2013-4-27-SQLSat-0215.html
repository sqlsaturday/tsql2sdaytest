<h3>Principles of BISM Tabular Modeling</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Although BISM Tabular is a powerful analytical engine that can efficiently link data across multiple sources, it is common to get stuck when attempting to connect tables and generate calculations to leverage all sources in a single model.  Many issues regularly encountered by BI developers (and data analysts when using PowerPivot) can be attributed to violations of one or more of the relationship rules of the Tabular engine. It is necessary to understand those rules in order to handle increasingly complex semantic modeling requirements.

On this session, attendees will gain an understanding of the fundamental principles which must be followed to develop effective models in BISM Tabular as well as PowerPivot.

<h3>Putting Quality Back Into Your Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session introduces Data Quality Services, a new feature of SQL Server 2012.  One of the challenges in developing Business Intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data does not have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, and data duplication.  Sometimes you even need to consolidate data from more than one source that may have different standards and format.  Microsoft’s solution in SQL 2012 is Data Quality Services (DQS).  In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data.  I will end the session with a set of demonstration of how DQS works with different data problems to help you put quality back into your data.</p>

<h3>GeoSpatial Analytics Using Microsoft BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this age of big data, location matters more than many people imagine. Almost every set of data has some geographic information tied to it, and it is all the more pertinent to understand and unravel the patterns and trends behind them. This session will start by explaining why GeoSpatial analytics is important in today's world and then continue by exploring how we can share, analyze, and visualize data using the comprehensive Microsoft BI toolset, including Power View, GeoFlow, SQL Server Reporting Services, and more.

<h3>Database Projects - An Introduction</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database projects have come a long way since the first fumbling attempts.  The newest incarnation is SSDT (Sql Server Development Tools) and it has left behind the false errors and obtuse directory hierarchy of database projects past.  Database projects have finally evolved to where they can be integrated into your daily build cycle!  I know, I know, I was skeptical too; and I don't mean to disillusion you into thinking it will all work fine right out of the box -- no, we're not close to there yet! Come to this session and let me introduce you to the strengths, weaknesses, caveats, and workarounds of database projects.</p>
