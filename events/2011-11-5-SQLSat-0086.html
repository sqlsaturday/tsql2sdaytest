<h3>Using MS Access as a BI Tool with SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Access is a wonderful BI analysis tool. It allows users to leverage the native capabilities for Crosstab queries along with some powerful UI mechanisms to provide a rich BI environment. In this session I'll be using VBA and SQL Server to extend the tools even further:
We will cover three topics: Creating a Access dashboard using a SQL Server stored procedure; creating a Crosstab analysis with subtotals in table format and creating a flexible Crosstab analysis using Access's Crosstab table form. You will walk away with new methods to do BI analysis using the World's most popular desktop database. </p>

<h3>PowerPivot: BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The paradox of Business Intelligence: it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor. Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us. Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow? In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications). The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :) I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)

<h3>Do You Know the Data Flow?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Data Flow task is one of the most powerful and most complex tools available in SSIS. Whether you are brand new to SSIS, or you’ve been using it for a while, it’s likely you’ve had some questions about the Data Flow. Why are some components so much slower than others? Why can’t I store a value (like a row count) in one component, and use it in another component later in the Data Flow? And why does it always seem to be the part of my package that fails when I run it against real data? Well, you’re not alone. During this session, we’ll answer these questions (and many others) by learning how the Data Flow operates internally. After attending this session, you’ll know a lot more about getting the most out of Data Flows in SSIS.</p>

<h3>SQL - External Data Source for SharePoint  Office</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we will examine how to create connections to an external data source (SQL Server) using SharePoint Designer.  Once the External Data Content Type exists, we can display and manipulate the data within SharePoint using an External List.  But you will see in this session that you can also surface the data to Outlook and use the data in a disconnected mode.  You will also see how to use external data sources within a Word document template with the assistance of QuickParts.  The final demonstration (time permitting) shows how you can use the external data in an InfoPath form.</p>

<h3>Do More (ETL) with Less (Effort) - Automating SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, for simple, straightforward data transfer tasks or packages that adhere to a pattern, creating SSIS packages by hand can be time-consuming and repetitious. By attending this session, you'll learn how to automate package creation in SSIS, including the dynamic generation of data flows. We’ll cover some of the free and open source tools available for this, and discuss “roll your own” options.</p>

<h3>Lookup Between The Lines is Data Late Than Never</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Fully cached lookups are GREAT for performance in ETL processing.  These types of lookups use a query to pull a limited data set into the SSIS memory cache.  Then, in processing, a exact match is made on lookup values to provide the match lookup value.   However, what if you need to match on more than on value, or use BETWEEN type lookups?  This is possible, and this session will examine some solutions.  Also, we will talk about making allowances for missing data when running ETL processes, strategies for late arriving dimensions and late arriving facts. </p>

<h3>SSIShare The Code, Man</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For many SSIS scenarios, a desired outcome is to implement logic or rules that are already in use in existing enterprise applications.  The only significant difference is that the implementation is done in a bulk data loading scenario.  Many times the logic being applied is complex and multi-step.  Many times enterprises have proprietary rules systems that need consistent application throughout the code base.  We will examine a scenario where complex logic from shared code sources can be applied in SSIS processing.</p>

<h3>Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you’ve used SSIS to populate a simple star schema data mart, and everybody’s happy.

How do you handle those in a scalable, efficient way in SSIS? This session will present some common patterns for handling these scenarios. You’ll learn when to use each advanced approach and the pros and cons associated with each pattern. You will learn how to implement these patterns in SSIS, and how to tune them for high performance.</p>
