<h3>Change Data Capture a tool for BI,DR,Audit  more</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the newest features available for SQL Server 2008 which allows you to easily track and keep history of all DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes on user tables such as INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE without additional overhead. One of the most important benefits of this feature is that it allows you to see the data before  after an UPDATE statement which allows you to recover data overwritten or deleted quickly without the need of a database restore.

On this presentation we will go over the steps necessary to configure CDC and do an overview of some real world scenarios where this feature can be applied such as Business Intelligence, Disaster Recovery, Auditing, Debugging, Documentation and more.</p>

<h3> Database design with performance in mind</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of SQL Server is simplicity. Developer creates a database, write a few T-SQL statements and everything is up and running.. until the system grows up and starts to introduce performance problems. And infinite loop begins: Refactor -> Deploy -> Refactor -> Deploy ->.. In a few years developer has gray hairs and ton of experience. 

The purpose of this session is sharing this experience helping to avoid some of the typical issues for the systems working under heavy load. The session gives the overview of how SQL Server stores data, what criteria Query Optimizer uses choosing the index, how data is locking - essential knowledge when you expect system to handle thousands transactions per second.

<h3>BLITZ! One Hour SQL Server Takeovers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You're minding your own business in your corner office - well, no, you're a DBA, so it's just your cubicle - when somebody says, "Did you know about this SQL Server over here?" Suddenly, you have to find out what the server's doing, how it was set up, and whether things are working correctly. In this real-time session, Brent will show you how he tackles unknown servers in 60 minutes to find problems, take an inventory, and set the server up for easier management down the road.</p>

<h3>Creating a C# Runtime Dynamic SSIS Designer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS enables us to quickly create deployable packages to move/manipulate data. Things do however get a bit challenging when source and destination tables are not known at package design time or when a requirement exists to have an already-deployed package support schema changes in source tables. One solution to this problem is to leverage our ability to create and execute an SSIS package dynamically in code.

In this session we will take a look at a complete project for a C# Runtime SSIS Package Designer, taking as input a set of table names and dynamically generating both destination Access tables then creating, validating, saving and executing an SSIS Package at runtime with logging enabled to demonstrate the various package steps.</p>

<h3>The DBA Script Thumb</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will present a top 10 (maybe 20) list of queries and tools that DBAs can use daily. The idea is that everything is included on a single 1G or less thumb drive to be portable. From simple T-SQL statements to full blown SSIS packages, the session demonstrates how to interogate, diagnose, report on, and resolve issues that are most prevalent for DBAs: disk space, security, backup locations, database and server documentation, performance and much more. All queries, which are SQL 2000, 2005 and yes even 2008 tried and true will be made available in the session to copy to your own thumb drive. If you are lucky you might even receive a free coveted thumb to store the queries.

<h3>Locking and Blocking for Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Locking, blocking, waits.. Why developers should care? Those things are for DBA. But what if you don't have DBA in the team? What if DBA complaints directly to your boss? 

This session will provide you an overview how SQL Server Lock Manager works; how different isolation levels affect the system; gives you bird-eye view of SQLOS and Sql Server Waits; provide you the guidelines how to minimize the locking, avoid deadlocks and improve concurrency of the system. It also shows you a couple of basic methods how to troubleshot problems related with locking and concurrency.</p>

<h3>Log Shipping vs. Replication; the Great Debate</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many SQL Server DBA's are tasked with the responsibility of choosing an appropriate disaster recovery, reporting, or failover solution for their organization.  Much of the time the choice comes down to replication versus log shipping.  And while both solutions can be extremely effective, there are both subtle  major differences between them that can guide you to choose one over the other.  This presentation gets to the nuts and bolts of the two technologies, and helps you make an educated recommendation and implementation.</p>
