<h3>T-SQL Fundamentals: Logical Processing Order</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>“Column dbo.xyz' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.” Seen it; fixed it, but can we explain why we’re getting a syntax in the first place? The optimizer must follow a very specific hierarchy in order to generate a plan. When you understand the hierarchy, then you better understand the behavior of the optimizer.
 
This all-demo session will explain the logical processing hierarchy, giving you the foundation knowledge you need to build well-structured queries that keep the optimizer happy. Learn how the FROM clause is processed, why a calculated column’s alias can’t be addressed in the JOIN, why WHERE isn’t the only filter, and why NULL confuses everything. When you leave, you will think very differently about how you build your queries, and the query optimizer will love you for learning to speak its language.

<h3>Windows Azure SQL Database Troubleshooting and Query Tuning </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Windows Azure SQL Database is a fully-managed, scalable service based on SQL Server technology. It is also a shared-environment service which means that you can’t and shouldn’t avoid best practices when it comes to query tuning. Microsoft has put mechanisms in place to ensure that your queries and processes don’t use up too many resources which could seriously impact performance of not only your database, but the database of other organizations as well. This demo-filled session will look at tools and options available to help identify poor performing queries, such as dynamic management views. This session will help identify problem queries and help you understand why a query is running slow through execution plans and other tools in the SQL Database Portal. Ultimately, you will be enabled to find and fix your poorly performing queries and do it all in the cloud.</p>

<h3>An Introduction to Indexes and How to Use Them for Maximum Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you find yourself battling to describe the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index. Do you struggle with unhappy users and bad performance. Do you want to know how to identify missing indexes or duplicate indexes? Indexes are a vital cog in the SQL Server engine and getting them right is one of the best performance tuning techniques available. A simple index can make the difference between a sub-second result or waiting 30 minutes for data. A simple index can also make the difference between happy and unhappy users. So what are indexes exactly and why do they make my life so much easier? Find out here.</p>

<h3>Enhance SQL Performance by Messaging and Queuing Applications</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When you think of SQL Server, the first thing you think about is probably not SQL as host for messaging / queuing applications. However, in certain scenarios it definitely makes sense to implement messaging inside the SQL engine. In this session we will see the benefits of messaging applications inside SQL as well as what options you have when implementing it and their respective performance implications.</p>

<p>A family man, Christian, starcraft addict with some SQL on the side.

Working on SQL for a long time, started on V6.5. I have seen way to many versions of SQL/BI tools for any sane person. ‘There is evil here that does not sleep” and as far as I can will help where I can. As the “about” title says I wear sandals (Afrikaans: Plakkies) do not like shoes to my wifes/boss dismay. I enjoy going off-road with my “toyota” and when I am not “sql”ing I will be constructing something from wood.</p>
