<h3>Revenge: The SQL!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?
Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</p>

<h3>Query Store without SQL 2016 = Open Query Store</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When SQL Server 2016 was released, it offered a fantastic new feature with the Query Store. Long term, statistics based, query tuning became a reality. But what about the thousands of servers that aren't upgrading to SQL 2016 or newer? The open source project Open Query Store is designed to fulfill that need.

This session will give a short introduction to the Query Store feature in SQL 2016 and then dive into the Open Query Store (OQS) solution. William (co-creator of the OQS project) will explain the design of OQS and demonstrate the features. You will leave this session with an understanding of the features of Query Store and Open Query Store, and a desire to implement OQS in your systems when you return to the office.</p>

<h3>dbachecks - The PowerShell Module to validate your SQL Estate</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a SQL DBA you want to know that your SQL Server Estate is compliant with the rules that you have set up. Now there is a simple method to set this up using PowerShell and you can get the results in PowerBi or a report emailed to you on a schedule. Details such as

How long since your last backup?
How long since your last DBCC Check?
Are your Agent Operators Correct?
Is AutoClose, AutoShrink, Auto Update Stats set up correctly?
Is DAC Allowed?
Are your file growth settings correct, what about the number of VLFs?
Is your latency, TCP Port, PS remoting as you expect?
Is Page Verify, Data Purity, Compression correctly set up?

and many more checks (even your own) can be achieved using the dbachecks PowerShell module brought to you by the dbatools team.

<h3>Daily indexing problems and its - possible - solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever been in the situation that an application performed well the last day and - suddenly - you run into problems? Although you have Index Maintenance jobs and statistics up to date you will monitor a big degrade of performance! This session will demonstrate in a over 80 percent demo based presentation the following scenarios which happend this way in real life!
- Why performance degradation in spite of maintenance jobs?
- just one more database in the result set and the query runs really bad - why?
- usage of literals is completely different from the usage of variables - why?
- identical data types but the query runs in part perfect and in part bad...
- your execution plan shows an INDEX SEEK - but the table will be scanned!
- you get a query from the business which performs really bad but when you test it it runs pretty cool - why?</p>

<h3>DevOps, CI and the Data Warehouse [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps and continuous integration provide huge benefits to data warehouse development. However, most BI professionals have little exposure to the tools and techniques involved.  John will be showing how you can use Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to build and test your data warehouse code and how to use Octopus Deploy to deploy everything to UAT and production. 

This is a demo heavy session which will introduce you to exactly how powerful DevOps can be in practice and will cover:

* Setting up Visual Studio Team Services to act as your build server 
* How to use Octopus Deploy to deploy your entire data warehouse 
* Developing a build-centric PowerShell script with psake 
* Building and deploying SQL Server Data Tools projects with DAC Publish profiles 
* Writing and running automated unit tests 
* The many problems of automating tabular model deployments

<h3>Introduction to Managed Instances</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What are Azure SQL Database Managed Instances?
The range of options for storing data in Microsoft Azure keeps growing, the most notable recent addition is the Managed Instance. But what is it, and why is it there? Join John as he walks through what they are
and how you might start using them.

Managed Instances add a new option for running workloads in the cloud. Allowing near parity with a traditional on-premises SQL Server. Including SQL Agent, Cross Database Queries, Service Broker, CDC, and many more. Overcoming many of the challenges to using Azure SQL Databases.

But, what is the reality, how do we make use of it, and are there any gotcha’s that we need to be aware of? This is what we will cover, going beyond the hype and looking at how we can make use of this new technology, working through a full migration including workload analysis, selecting the appropriate migration pathway and then putting it in place.</p>

<h3>Beyond image classification - object detection  with multi-task deep models</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Object detection can be challenging to understand, mostly because there is a gap in the literature between image classification and object detection — the former is explained in deluge of easy to understand blog posts and articles, the latter is the subject of research papers, full of scary looking math.
In this session we will take different approach and built state of the art object detection model in easy to understand steps. First, we are going to make sure that everybody understand concepts of convolution networks, the importance of  model architecture and loss function. 
Then we are going to build a model that will classify single object, a model that finds this object on a picture, and a model that combine both and is able to classify and localize the largest object in each image.
Finally, we will move to multiple objects detection, discus latest architectures and design appropriate loss function for this task. All this illustrated with examples built using fastai library.</p>

<h3>Graph Data in SQL 2017</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When I read that Microsoft have added graph data to SQL Server 2017 I was intrigued as to what graph data is so I started doing some research.
This presentation is the culmination of my investigations. 
If you design complex OLTP relational databases or have data that doesn't fit the rigid hierarchy of a relational database then this talk is for you. 
You may be in for a surprise!

Some of the questions we will look at:
What is Graph Data?
Who uses it?
What is it used for?
How does it compare to traditional relational database design?
What other companies support graph databases?
How does it work in SQL 2017?
Is there a new language to learn?
What is the so-called Kevin Bacon problem?

And finally.
Will it replace traditional relational database design within the next 10 years?</p>

<h3>Intelligent Query Processing in SQL Server 2019 CTP2</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2017 started with query processing improvements called Adaptive Query Processing. Now, in SQL Server 2019 CTP2, there are additional improvements, and all of them are packed in a feature with the most promising name - Intelligent Query Processing. 

The intention of these improvements is to fix poor performing queries due to wrong cardinality estimations and other sub-optimal plan decisions, and hereby enhance query performance with almost no code changes. 

This session will cover briefly all these features: Batch and Row Mode Memory Grant Feedback, Batch Mode Adaptive Join and Interleaved Execution, Table Variable Deferred Compilation, and Approximate Query Processing.

The session will address questions such as do I need to tune queries anymore, does the IQP solves parameter sniffing issues and so on, and also suggest how much improvements you should expect with this promising set of feautures.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Factory v2 with Data Flows capabilities</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft's services in Azure helps us to leverage big data more easily and even more often accessible for non-technical users. Having UI in ADF version 2 - Microsoft added a new feature: Data Flow which resembles components of SSIS. This is a very user-friendly and non-code approach tool-set.
But, has that been only UI introduction? Why and how Databricks does work under the hood?
Do you want to know this new (still in private preview) feature of ADF and reveal the power of modern big data processes without knowledge of such languages like Python or Scala?
We will review this new feature of ADFv2, do deep dive to understand the mentioned techniques, compare them to SSIS and/or T-SQL and learn how modelled data flow runs Scala behind the scenes.</p>

<h3>The Microsoft Power Platform - What is it?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>May I introduce you to the Microsoft Power Platform!? 
This new term was introduced by Satya Nadella and James Philips as the serving foundation for building powerful (cloud-baked) applications. PowerApps as the data manipulation part, Microsoft Flow as the connecting workflow engine and Power BI for analysis and reporting. In addition, the Common Data Service (CDS) and the Common Data Model (CDM) provide a solid framework for data storage and modelling.
Join me in this session if you want to get an overview about the involved technologies, how they work together, see them live  working together in many demos and how they will definitely change the way of building powerful solutions in the future!</p>

<h3>ETL with Azure Databricks, The Complete Introduction</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Databricks seems to be the new sheriff in town. It promises easy but capable ETL (amongst other things). But how does it work? For an SSIS (and possibly BIML) person this all looks new and strange. Python notebooks? Scala? Spark? What is all this, and where do I start? Well, you start by coming to this presentation. We’ll take a look at how to approach making an Azure Databricks based ETL solution from start to finish. Along the way it will become clear how Azure Databricks works and we will use our SSIS based ETL knowledge to see if it can handle the common use-cases from our daily jobs. And of course we will also have some fun and see how fast it can go!</p>

<h3>50 ways to show your data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>„A picture is worth a thousand words“ - well, that is especially true when it comes to analyzing data. Visualization is the quick and easy way to get the big ‘picture’ in your data and the R ecosystem has a lot to offer in this regard. 

They may not add up to exactly 50, but in this session I’ll show you lots of compelling visualizations produced with the help of the ggplot2 package and friends - and their usual small effort of coding. We will start beyond the usual bar, line or scatter plots. 

Instead our screen will show diagrams that always made you think „How do they do that?“. We will see waterfall diagrams, violins, ridgelines, marginal histograms, maps and more… and you’ll get the code to reproduce everything.</p>

<h3>One Click Solution in Excel (the refresh idea)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Modern Excel has gone way beyond what Excel 2007 was. With Power Pivot and Power Query, one can create solutions that are still very complex and yet require very little maintenance. What used to be two weeks out of every month is now a few days of work once and then just hitting that refresh button. And the importance of this is not just in the time-saving, it's also eliminating human error and one could say cures depression due to repeated dead-end tasks every month. This means that Analysts could actually get to the analysis part of their work and not spend the vast majority of their time doing data cleaning and manual work.</p>

<h3>SQL server security out of the box!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>During different security tests, we have discovered, that a lot of SQL Server installations manage actions Start, Next, Next, Finish pretty good. A lot of times very valuable data lives in these default setups and installations. The main question is if this is enough to have rock solid and most important secure installation. During the presentation, we will try to find some answers to this questions and give some hints, how can we make SQL Server and the ecosystem around it more secure.</p>

<p>Lifting and shifting your application to the cloud is extremely easy, on paper. The hard truth is that the only way to know for sure how it is going to perform is to test it. Benchmarking on premises is hard enough, but benchmarking in the cloud can get really hairy because of the restrictions in PaaS environments and the lack of tooling.
Join me in this session and learn how to capture a production workload, replay it to your cloud database and compare the performance. I will introduce you to the methodology  and the tools to bring your database to the cloud without breaking a sweat.</p>
