<h3>Getting Started with the Entity Framework 4.0</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll…
 
•         Explore the Entity Framework 4.0, its related components and show how it all works
•         Demonstrate how to build a business object model (Entity Data Model) and database mappings, from a database, from a model or from code
•         Walk through a variety of examples of how to interact with the model 
•         Take a close look at how and why EF 4.0 implements “Persistence Ignorance”
•         Show how to implement Entity Framework in a multi-tiered application

You’ll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the Entity Framework 4.0 can greatly simplify your DAL and enable you to program against a conceptual model of your data, versus the actual data store itself

<h3>Introduction to NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) have started to make their way into mainstream .NET development with the advent of LINQ-to-SQL and the Entity Framework from Microsoft. Before that, though, there was NHibernate. Based on the Java Hibernate project, NHibernate is one of the most mature .NET ORMs in the marketplace. The Fluent NHibernate project builds on this to make NHibernate a breeze to configure. In this presentation, Brian will discuss the pros and cons of ORMs in general, and demonstrate how NHibernate can take the pain out of writing your persistence layer.</p>

<h3>Conceptual Data Modeling: Defining Our Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data modeling is the process of defining structure for data. Some systems might make this seem like something that occurs in a deep well at midnight with water-soluble markers, but a well defined data model can provide greater system longevity, less complexity in application and reporting development, better capability for performance improvements, and less long-term volatility. This session will discuss concepts of data modeling, signs of a well defined model, technical and non-technical benefits we can use for approaching different audiences, and some of the tools we can use in different stages of modeling. We'll wrap up with a practical example of converting business language into the first stages of a conceptual data model.</p>

<h3>Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting (as time allows).</p>

<h3>Advance Your Debugging Skills with VS 2010</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll …
 
•         Dive deep into the new IntelliTrace feature, which enables you to step back in time within your debugging session and inspect or re-execute code, without having to restart your application.
•         See how to manage large numbers of breakpoints with labeling, searching and filtering.
•         Extend “data tips” by adding comments, notes and strategically “pinning” these resources to maintain their visibility throughout your session.
•         Demonstrate “collaborative debugging,“ by debugging a portion of an application and then exporting breakpoints and labeled data tips, so that others can leverage your effort, without having to start over.

<h3>Database Maintenance Essentials</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many DBAs take routine database maintenance for granted. What they don’t understand is that the cumulative effect of poor database maintenance can significantly hurt performance and reduce uptime.

<h3>Deciding if VMs are a good choice for your SQL Svr</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.</p>

<h3>Running mixed workloads on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p> In an ideal world, you can separate your OLTP traffic and reporting so the databases can be optimized for their respective workloads. In the real world, this is not always an option. Real time data means reporting off of the OLTP environment. We will first look at the shortcomings of different reporting solutions. We will then look at features that help a mixed work play nicely together. Some of these features include filtered indexes, indexes views, persisted computed columns, data compression, resource governor, partitioning and others. We will also touch on database design concepts that can help mixed workloads and leave you with topics to research further so you master the juggling act that is mixed workloads</p>

<h3>CDC + SSIS = SCD</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Building dimensions using the Slowly changing dimension wizard in SSIS is simple and quick.  However its performance and flexibility is questionable.  Even further, when trying to perform incremental loads of your Dimensions using the aforementioned approach or a custom approach prior to Change Data Captured (CDC) offered certain challenges.  In this session Patrick will show you how to utilize CDC and SSIS to incrementally load Type I and Type II dimensions using features that are all native to SQL Server 2008.</p>

<h3>RESTful Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With WCF Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This session will describe OData (the Open Data Protocol), the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.</p>

This session will be a step by step process of taking 2 different examples (Labatory and Fund Agreement) through normalization. The databases will be diagrammed and scripted out with primary, alternate and foreign keys, defaults, constraints and to Null or Not to Null. Some cool examples will be used to show just how powerful normalization can be and what SQL Server 2005/2008 features can enhance the delivery of information to the end user.</p>

<h3>C# Ninjitsu</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>C# has humble beginnings as an object oriented language of the purest kind. It was class-based, it was imperative, and it was component-oriented. For many years, the classic object-oriented design principles served class library designers well. But C# is no longer a purely object oriented language. It is no longer an imperative, class-based, component oriented discipline. It is also a generic, declarative, functional discipline. I will reexamine the object-oriented principles and introduce new principles. I will then introduce new refactorings as we move toward a more declarative, fluent world.</p>
