<h3>Visualizing performance tuning data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Just staring at the output from for instance sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats is usualy not very helpful. Creating delta's from the data and then representing it as a graph helps to understand that data. Over the years I've tried various ways to look at output from SQL Server for performance tuning reasons. In this session I will share a couple of them with you. We will look at virtual_file_stats, waitstats, the buffer cache etc. and we will visualize them in various ways to make it easier to draw conclusions. The visualisation techniques vary from simple graphs that combine throughput and latency to more complicated scenarios that I saw being used by Formula 1 on tv, which translate well to Waitstats and Buffer pool cache usage.

<h3>The elephant in the room: Continuous Delivery for Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s talk about constraints. What’s holding you back from achieving Continuous Delivery?

Databases.

If it’s painful, do it often... Your app is automatically integrated, tested and packaged for deployment in minutes. But what about databases?

Of course, databases come with complications and risks. We’ll talk about both the human and technical changes which are necessary to achieve a reliable, nimble, and automated database deployment process.

You’ll learn how to bring Dev and Ops closer together as well as customize established practices and existing toolsets to build a database deployment pipeline and speed up delivery while at the same time protecting the data (and your sanity).

There will be four example scenarios to choose from based on four different technology stacks - so for the demo you can vote on your favourite tooling!

By the end of the session, delegates will have learned that the elephant in the room is now: ‘Why aren’t we doing Continuous Delivery for d</p>

<h3>When good SQL design goes bad</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Take what you’ve learned about SQL Server and turn it upside down. 

 In this humorous session I’ll be debating many of the so called "best practices" in SQL Server and demonstrating counter arguments. Come along to see how so called "pillars" of design are starting to break down. 
•When you should NOT use stored procedures.
•When we don’t need indexes.
•When Clustered Tables are bad.
•When Identity Columns should not be Primary Keys.
•When we don’t care about fragmentation.
•When good naming convention’s go bad.
•Why Partitioning often makes your queries slower.
•Why do ORMs really makes sense when they make all your parameters nvarchar (max)

 Health Warning: These may not be the design tips you should be using on your production OLTP. </p>

<h3>Biml for Beginners: Generating SSIS packages with BimlScript</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating the actual SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over again. There are no easy ways to handle metadata and schema changes, and if there are new requirements you might have to go through all the packages one more time. It's time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself principle to SSIS development. 

In this session I will use the free BIDS Helper add-in to show you the basics of Biml and BimlScript, how to generate SSIS packages automatically from databases, how easy those packages can be changed, and how to move common code to separate files that can be included where needed. See why they say Biml allows you to complete in a day what once took more than a week! 

This session is intended for SSIS developers who are not yet familiar with Biml.</p>

<h3>Analizing Text with SQL Server 2014 and R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Text mining is becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media. Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions. Semantic Search, a new component in Full-Text Search, can help you understanding the meaning of documents. The Term Extraction and Term Lookup components from SQL Server Integration Services also help with text analysis. Free statistical package / language R is also useful for the text mining tasks. However, the question arises: is all this enough? This presentation unveils the good and the bad side of text mining with the tools mentioned.</p>

<h3>Microsoft SQL Server AlwaysOn in a Multi-Site world</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Multi-Site configurations are the natural progression from the more orthodox Failover Cluster Instances that form the basis previous High Availability configurations. With the introduction of Availability Groups and multi-subnet capability with SQL Server 2012 it is now even easier to build a multi-site  multi-subnet solution. With this ease of deployment it is more important than ever to look at the important configuration options that can have a big impact in multi-site implementations but not in single-site.

Covering things like Asymmetric storage configurations, DNS considerations and the advances in clustering. By the end of this session, you will be in a position to confidently start building out multi-site Highly Available and ef</p>

<h3>Introduction to Execution Plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Maybe you are a developer who is quite comfortable writing T-SQL queries and stored procedures, but maybe someone has started asking about performance issues.  Maybe you have tuned the query and it runs fine; maybe someone is asking for you to tune it that little bit more, but you don't know where to start. Maybe someone has mentioned execution plans, but you don't really know much about them.  In this session Kevan will explain what execution plans are, where they come from, what they are used for and why are they so important that everyone keeps going on about them.  You will find out how to produce them, how to understand them and how to use them to find opportunities for further performance tuning.  This session will take you to the next level of understanding what SQL Server is doing under the covers when it runs your query.</p>

<h3>Statistics, Estimation   Plan Caching - The Big Three</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will take an in depth look at statistics, how they are built, stored and used. We will go over why they are so important and what role they play in selecting a query plan. We will also take a look into estimation and how this affects query plan selection and how estimation and statistics tie together.

Also in this session we will take a look into plan caching, what it is, why it is done and how it can be both a help and a hindrance.

Using lots of demos and examples attendees will leave the session with a greater understanding of these three key areas and also the tools and techniques to work with and understand them in their own enviroments

<h3>FILETABLEs: What They Are and How to Use Them</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever had the need to access documents in your database as if they were files in the file system? SQL Server 2012 introduces a brand new method for managing large data objects (BLOBs) in a database. FILETABLEs provide access to data using Transact-SQL - just like any other table inside the database, while at the same time also provide access to the data using the operating system File I/O API - i.e. just like any other folder in the file system. In this session you will learn how to upgrade your document management solutions by migrating your large data to FILETABLEs. The session covers two most typical migration scenarios: migrating from a distributed data store, where files are stored outside the database, and from a homogeneous d</p>

<h3>Certification and IT Career - Self Case Study</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Several years of work in one industry. A few years in another. The first professional exams, certification and specialization. For last few years, the next - this time in ICT. Even more exams (successful or not), the requirements, specializations, orientations. Is certification for information technology or information technology for the certification? Where to start, what to stop. Where is the end to the possibilities, and where the boundary joy of work. As far as proving something to someone in need IT career. These and several other strange, philosophical, perhaps unnecessary questions I will answer. A few would be left to their own assessment.</p>

<h3>Load Testing With SQL Server Tools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s often difficult to know how your SQL Servers will perform under different loads. By performing load testing, we can gain these key insights, perform modifications to existing configurations, and understand the impact on performance levels.

Come learn about the native tools at our disposal for performing these important load tests and how we can identify when performance levels begin to drop. Using demos of these native tools – including Distributed Replay Utility (DRU), Database Tuning Adviser (DTA), Perfmon, Extended Events, and Profiler – we’ll see how to plan and perform a load test project, gain an understanding of SQL Server’s performance under varying load scenarios, and discover which tell-tale indicators can help alert us to performance degradation.</p>

<h3>Run your DBA morning checklist with policy based management while sipping coffee</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In my job as a SQL Consultant, I have my weekly recurring customers. They don’t have a DBA, so I have to perform the daily DBA checklist on a weekly basis ;) Initially, I've started with executing some T-SQL scripts to verify the SQL Servers. But as more servers were installed, my DBA checklist became really time consuming and I didn't even have the time for a coffee… In this session you will learn how you can perform your DBA morning checklist while sipping coffee. I will demonstrate how you can use Policy Based Management to evaluate your servers and how I configured my setup. By the end of this session, I guarantee you will have more time for your morning coffee!</p>

<h3>SSRS Inception: Reporting on Reporting services.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Still using Reporting Services? Yeah me too! Does this scenario sound familiar? You already have a large SSRS environment but the users still want more reports. You create a new, all singing, all dancing dashboard that removes the need for a bunch of reports, awesome. You launch it and explain to the business  that you are deprecating the old reports. "WAIT! We still need that for Jill in HR to do her end-of-month", or "We might still need that" - these types of comments are what leads to having a load of reports that are not being used.  
 
Wouldn't it be great if you could see who is viewing a report, in what format and how often, all inside your current SSRS environment? With this data wouldn't it then be even better if we could automate a process to email the owner of that report to say "HA! I told you no one looked at this report!". In this session we will look at how we can do all of this and more by mining the SSRS DB. </p>

<h3>You did WHAT to my transaction log?!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You won't believe what people will do to the transaction log when they get into trouble. The log is full! The application is experiencing strange errors! Do something! In this session, I will apply commonly suggested advice from internet search results and various forums, in search of a fast remedy for explosive log growth. How bad could it be?! Fortunately, once you understand what the transaction log looks like, how SQL Server uses it to guarantee database consistency, and the factors that can prevent reuse of log space, the dangers of 'quick fix' advice will become readily apparent, as will the right way to diagnose and fix a full log file. Note: no production servers will be harmed during this presentation.

<h3>Machine Learning without a PhD in statisitcs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Machine learning is the science of making computers act without being unambiguously programmed. Machine learning (ML) is something that we use every day when we search and shop on the web and talk to our devices. Microsoft Azure ML is a fully-managed cloud service that enables data aware developers to efficiently embed predictive analytics into their applications,  without a PhD in statistics helping organizations use massive data sets and bring all the benefits of the cloud to machine learning. So join Andrew for a practical insight into the fascinating world of Machine Learning, where you can be significantly different but never certain, deviation is normal, and you are amongst friends if you found the above quote funny.</p>

<h3>SQL Server and Application Security for Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A lot of companies have a philosophy of "ship early with as many features as possible.” Security is an afterthought since it isn't fun to do and no one will attack them anyway. However, the dark side never sleeps, and security breaches have always happened, often leaving companies severely exposed or even bankrupt.
In this session we'll look at a few attack vectors that can be used against your company, and what you as a developer can and should do to protect against them. It will involve a good mix of security conscious SQL Server and application development, because you care about your work and nobody messes with you.</p>

<h3>The first step towards continuous integration for SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Continuous integration (CI) is a development practice that has become widely adopted for the application layer because it allows teams to detect problems quickly and locate errors more easily. By regularly integrating code into a shared repository and automatically verifying it you'll build confidence in your code.

But database CI continues to be a painful, manual process in many projects. Redgate supports developers through the first steps in setting up databases CI and in this session, I will show you:

-How easy it is to get your SQL Server database changes in source control using Redgate’s SQL Source Control.
-How to set up an automated build process for your databases using the DLM Automation Suite and Team City.
-How this process helps you spot and fix errors quicker.
-How to produce an artifact you can use for reliable, repeatable deployments in the future.

One lucky session attendee will also win a licence of SQL Source Control.</p>

<h3>Loading Dimensions with SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are many different ways of using SSIS to load data into a Data Warehouse. To populate a simple star schema it is quite easy to use an SCD transformation task  in SSIS. But when you want to handle advanced Data Warehouse requirements such as Type 3 SCDs, auditing execution details, error logs and fast performance, the SCD transformation makes it difficult. In this session I will present a pattern which can handle these in a scalable , efficient way in SSIS.I will also show how this pattern will benefit us when we use the Kimball audit model ,SSISDB and the SSIS catalog in SQL Server 2012.</p>
