<h3>Dimensional Modeling Design Patterns: Beyond Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dimensional modeling is arguably one of the most important
fundamentals of business intelligence.  It is still relevant even as
new technologies like PowerPivot and SSAS Tabular Models are becoming
more popular.  Correctly modeling your organization's data not only
protects the most important asset your company has but ensures that
your data mart or data warehouse will be responsive and capable of
accommodating emerging requirements.

This session provides a deeper dive into 
the art of dimensional modeling. We will look at the different types of fact tables and dimension tables, how and when to use them. We will also some approaches to creating rich hierarchies that make reporting a snap. Finally we will cover  physical design choices.This case study and demo based session promises to be very interactive and engaging, bring your toughest Dimensional Modeling quandaries.</p>

<h3>Extending Your Availability Group for Disaster Recovery</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did you know that SQL Server Availability Groups can be a great solution for disaster recovery?  Availability groups have become well known for their high availability capabilities, and for good reason: they work well, they remove some of clustering’s limitations, and they are fairly straightforward to setup.  Extending an availability group to multiple sites for disaster recovery becomes more complicated.  A lot of moving parts have to come together for it to work properly - SQL Server, Windows, Active Directory, and DNS all get involved in this advanced configuration.  In this session, we’ll discuss some of the factors that complicate a multi-site availability group deployment, and we’ll walk through a multi-site deployment so you can see how it’s done.</p>

<h3>Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works (even in SQL Server 2016 CTP2), but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool. 
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool! 
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events.  
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king! </p>

<h3>Date Dimension: Past  Future in One Script</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>All data warehouses need a date and time dimension to enable proper analysis across time. Most Data Warehouse designers will just use one provided by tools or create it in Excel, but what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any date and time dimension you need by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary. Learn what it takes to design a date and time dimension that does all of the calculations and formatting up-front so the reports can be easier to create. Sample script will be provided that creates the date and time dimensions and can be reused as often as necessary without breaking your data warehouse and it only take seconds to run!</p>

<h3>Know what your machines are doing besides SQL Server - WMI, WQL, and PoSH</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There's far more occurring on your Windows servers than just SQL Server, and looking at ERRORLOG won't show you the whole story: other applications stealing your memory, OS issues, hardware errors, and more.  We'll start by looking at different ways to collect Event Logs.  From there we'll delve into WMI and WQL, which allow us to query servers (remotely or locally) to get information such as performance statistics, System and Event Logs, and even changes within SQL Server.

We'll finish it off with two immediately-usable implementations you can set up on Monday.</p>

<h3>Azure Machine Learning - Building New Value From Old Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We have lots and lots of data. Typically when it comes to data analysis we have to know what our measures of success are before we design our BI. These are typically manifested by competency, or domain driven KPI's but what if those metrics don't actually measure success at all?

In this talk we will be discussing how to leverage azure machine learning to answer questions in your organization about success and how to find the KPI's that really matter and drive results. </p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Window functions were first introduced with SQL Server 2005 and enhanced with SQL Server 2012. They enable easy development and great performance…well, sometimes. Learn what you need to know to take full advantage of these features. What you don’t know can hurt you when you are using window functions.</p>
