<h3>Big Data - The Biggest Fad of the Decade</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will investigate what Big Data really means, and more importantly - what it doesn't mean. 
What makes Big Data different than any other data? 
What makes Big Data challenges different than the same old challenges we had 30 years ago? 

Together, we will perform an honest, inquisitive, and enlightening investigation of what Big Data really is, it's origins, and how it evolved over the last decade. 
We will use history, analytics and logic to dissect the beast, and expose it for what it really is. 

Why should you care? 
The Big Data hype is holding you back from doing what is really important with data - getting value out of it. Making sense of it. 
Vendors, organizations, and architects have become so obsessed with the 'Big Data' fad, and too many either lost sight, or no longer have the resources to pursue their real goals. 

In this session I will plea to your reasoning, critical thinking, and plain common sense, to wake up and shout with me "The Emperor has no clo</p>

<h3>SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.</p>

<h3>DBA vNext</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Not long ago, being a Microsoft DBA meant be specialized in Microsoft SQL Server and all the whistles and bells shipped together in the same box. That was the on-prem age.

Now in the cloud computing age, all cloud providers support multiple database engines in order to welcome all applications to their infrastructure. SQL Server is not always the way to go for an application.

In this session full of demos, we will discuss what it takes to be an all-rounded Azure cloud DBA, best applicable scenarios, price budgeting and tuning.</p>

<h3>Wacky DAX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did you know the DAX language is far more capable than merely running a SUM over a column, or counting rows in a table? DAX sits on top of one of the fastest databases around, and this session will explore some unusual and creative scenarios that you previously would have thought as not possible using just DAX.

The session will aim to reset your understanding of what is possible in DAX by walking through some interesting code highlights from a recent series of games built using DAX. Each game pushes and explores different boundaries in DAX and will attempt to show just where those lines are.

The session will hopefully inspire you to add some creative and exciting techniques to your own DAX based data models.</p>

<h3>Power BI Dataset Tuning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most Power BI reports rely on a small dataset. And due to a lighting fast data engine most data model mistakes are shadowed by the speed of the service. When the dataset gets bigger then best data modeling practices are required. The trick here is Power BI data engine is not relational and therefore most data modeling techniques either don’t apply or don’t deliver. In this session we will go over how to model and measure performance for larger Power BI datasets.</p>

<h3>Imposter Syndrome   How to work through it</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>At one point or another most of us have had that feeling. You feel like you are about to be fired at any moment, like it is only a matter of time until they find out you don't know what you are doing and you are out of your depth. Or maybe you are sitting in a meeting with a group of your peers discussing the project you are working on. You see what you believe to be a large flaw in the current project, yet you do not speak up as you feel like you and not qualified enough to voice your concern. When your coworkers or boss pay you a compliment and try to express how impressed they are with you work or value as an employee do you try to diminish the complement or your value? If you have ever been in one of the situations above you have probably had a case of Imposter Syndrome. In this session we will discuss what Imposter Syndrome is, how it affects people and most importantly how to identify it in yourself and others and some techniques to help you break out of these feelings.</p>

<h3>Don't just code it—Generate It</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?</p>

<h3>Mastering Master Data Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Master Data Services enables you to manage a master set of your organization's data. You can organize the data into models, create rules for updating the data, and control who updates the data. With Excel, you can share the master data set with other people in your organization. Data stewards can use Excel to help manage the data repository and ensure that your MDS data is always up-to-date and accurate.

In this presentation we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this presentation, you will have a good understanding of what master data management is, what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.</p>

<h3>[StepByStep] SQL Server on Container? What is Kubernetes?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Docker and Kubernetes are becomes very hot industry since last couple of years.

SQL Server used to run only on Physical machine.
Now, it's not any more strange or wrong that SQL server run on VM.

This session is designed for understanding about container and how SQL server could run on container.

There are 2 types of applications, Stateless and Stateful.
We will go over the difference between them and will deliver the detail cases how SQL server could adjust in Container environment.

Therefore, developer or DBA could choose better architecture in various conditions.

Within this session will cover what the market demand is and what SQL server can do on the demand.</p>

<h3>Dynamic data flows in SSIS without programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. In contrast, COZYROC's Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated into the SSIS package at runtime without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at runtime. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</p>

<h3>Maximizing Big Data ROI via Best of Breed Technology Patterns  Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Not long ago the question was whether your organization had big data. Did you have the volume, the velocity, the technology. Now those basics are largely given for most people attending this event. The path to success is still fuzzy, however, with so many technologies to choose from – and so many ways to use them.
 
This presentation triangulates in a holistic manner on the modern business dilemma: how can we leverage technology to improve revenue, profit, market share, quality, and numerous other success criteria. That said, this is not about the analytics or KPIs -- although it is about measurable improvement. It’s about lining up the right technologies and using them in effective, proven ways to maximize Return on Investment (ROI). Since the slant here is holistic, we’ll show how to blend infrastructure, tools, methods, and talent to avoid and constantly trim technical debt… and to produce success stories that are consistently repeatable, not a byproduct of individual heroics.</p>

<h3>Dive into the Query Optimizer - Undocumented Insight</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</p>

<h3>I have indexes, but do I have the right indexes?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have all the right indexes on your SQL Server databases?   Have you implemented any indexes other than traditional clustered and non-clustered indexes?  If the answer to either question is a “no” or an “I don’t know”, then this session is for you.

This session will help introduce less commonly used index types and settings along with indexing methodologies.  Follow along while we learn which indexes your SQL Server is begging you to make and others it wishes you would drop.  Learn use cases for filtered, full-text, and columnstore indexes.  There will be plenty of demos and shareable scripts to showcase the benefits too!

Are you using a version and edition of SQL Server is able to use these features?  We’ll cover that too and you’ll leave this class with a repeatable indexing methodology you can use to improve your database performance.</p>

<h3>Open Source vs SQL Database Maintenance Plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Database Maintenance plans used to be a one size fits all tool that did a lot of unnecessary work, especially, when it came to indexing. So I have been recommending that clients use other tools such as Ola Hallengren’s award winning free SQL Server Maintenance Solution. So let’s have a showdown at high noon in the Arizona desert and see if Database Maintenance Plans in SQL 2016 and 2017 are now good enough or if we still need to turn to other solutions like Ola’s.</p>

<h3>What just happened? Creating your own real-time dashboard with Grafana, Influx, and Telegraf</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You wear many hats, know your KPI, fight those fires, and are used to -- but still scared of -- "hey, what just happened?"

As a DBA, you very likely have SQL Server well covered, but what about if/when you support Cassandra? Mongo? MySQL? What if you're DevOps and need something from ASP .Net? IIS? Nginx? 

In this interactive session, we'll go over show you how to locally install and configure InfluxDB to store your data, get Telegraf to pull, and with Grafana, create some quick dashboards.  Time permitting, we can set some thresholds, and send them to Slack. 

All of these tools are completely free, and if you don't have the right monitoring, or any, this is perfect for you.</p>

This session will show how to use the data in the ReportServer database to determine a smart migration strategy for upgrading to a new SSRS or Power BI Report Server. Starting with the new features of Report Manager, Mobile reports, KPIs and the Mobile Report Publisher app. The session will then focus on how to utilize the report meta data in the ReportServer database, combined with the transaction log table, to show how to determine which reports, data sets and data sources are being used and determine what objects to migrate. Learn how to use PowerShell to extract the reports and data sets from the database, instead of downloading them, to facilitate an easy migration to a new implementation. Also discover a way of determining all TSQL used by the reports. This session is particularly useful for migrating from 2008 but applicable to any migration.</p>

<h3>Doing Much More With Much Less: The Case for Data Warehouse Automation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the most pervasive problems in BI today is that data warehouses take too long to build and they are too hard to change. According to TDWI, building a data warehouse is among the most labor-intensive and time-consuming activities of BI development. There are so many moving parts—requirements, source data analysis, data quality, source-target mapping, data acquisition, data transformation logic, ETL design, scheduling, error handling—and getting it right the first time isn’t easy. And when you finally do get it right, something changes...

Join data warehouse automation pioneer WhereScape for this presentation to learn how companies like Nike, Costco, Cornell University, WSU, Daimler, Blue Cross, F5 accelerate warehouse development and change cycles while simultaneously assuring quality and consistency. A key aspect of doing automation right is that it should not get in the way of your developers – it should leverage existing skills, add best practices and generate documentation.</p>

<p>I am a technology leader with a strong focus on managing and mentoring talented teams to successful production of real business value. As a software engineer I learned the value of strong agile process methodology and disciplined enterprise architecture. I believe in services, platforms, and product-oriented delivery. As a leader, I strive to combine the technical and the personal to motivate people to do what they do best -- focus, code, and release. When that falls into place, computers also get to do what they do best -- keep running while we spend time with friends and family. My philosophy is that these two things need not be mutually unattainable!</p>

<p>Like most, Patrick accidentally found his way into SQL Server because MS Access couldn't handle Real Estate, even if it was Connecticut.  After discovering that DBAs can get paid pretty well to drink coffee and argue all day, a career was born.  20 something years later, Patrick has been fortunate to Administer, Architect, Develop, and Manage Databases, Networking, Storage, and Linux/Windows Systems of all shapes and sizes, covering companies in Accounting, Finance, Higher Education, Radio, Real Estate, Payroll, and now, Transportation Analytics.</p>
