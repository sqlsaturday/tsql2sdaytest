<h3>SQL Geography DataTypes and Applications</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>At some point in your SQL life you will be asked to calculate or visualize geospatial data.  Microsoft SQL server has unique optimizations and frameworks for handling just this circumstance.  Not to be confused with Geometric data (square and linear), Geographic data offers even more complexity as you deal with the curvature of the earth and its radial impact on queries.  Jared Nielsen is the Principal of the FUZION Agency and the CTO of Online and Digital for Universal Weather and Aviation and contends with geographic data on a daily basis.  FIR Boundary intersection, optimized flight planning, weather map overlay and multi-level airspace computations all involve some very interesting SQL Server geographic manipulations that may be interesting for you to experience if you haven't already.  Please join me for an in-depth review with helpful resources to guide you on your way as you incorporate Geospatial data into your own applications.</p>

<h3>A DBA's pick of differences between SQL Server and Oracle</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, I want to talk about 5 major differences between SQL Server and Oracle, namely: 
1. Backup, Restore, Recovery (RMAN vs T-SQL/Powershell) 
2. Schema (Single vs Multi tenants) 
3. Alter Index Rebuild (defragmentation) 
4. AWR, ASH vs DMV/DMF (Performance Trouble-shooting) 
5. Data Guard Mode vs AO Availability Group Mode (synch, asynch).  
I will reference my prior year presentation (SQLSaturday#308) how to automate Backup, Restore, Recover SQL Server, Alter Index for Defragmentation, and monitoring backups and agent jobs by using Powershell/T-SQL.
I will also reference my prior year presentation (HASSUG 11/2012) Trouble-shooting with Active Session History (powershell and T-SQL). 
I will show Oracle 12C in Oracle SQL Developer. Target audiences should have SQL Server DBA working knowledge and basic knowledge in Oracle on these topics. </p>

<h3>Building Bullet-Resistant SSIS Packages</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It's 2:30 a.m., and you've just gotten that call no ETL developer wants to get: an SSIS package has failed unexpectedly. Immediately, you start asking yourself: "What could have caused this?", "What do I do to fix the data from this failed execution?", and, most importantly, "Could I design the package in such a way that this doesn't happen again?"

In this demo-packed session, we will examine the design patterns and logistics of building error-resistant SSIS packages. Starting with the control flow, we'll work through various tools and patterns that can be used to prevent, or at least handle appropriately, task-level errors. We'll then move to the data flow, and discuss and demonstrate how to proactively address problem data to prevent unexpected package failures.

<h3>Managing Security in SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the world of extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), everything we do involves moving data from one point to another. However, very often the focus in SSIS package development is on functionality, not security. When building internal data transformation and movement processes, it is easy to forget that these operations broaden our security footprint, and must be actively managed to ensure that ETL doesn’t become the weak link in the security chain.
In this presentation, we’ll discuss the security features in SQL Server Integration Services, while reviewing best practices for securing your ETL infrastructure while providing enough (but not too much) access to those ETL assets. Among the topics we’ll cover:
	Properly securing connection passwords in SSIS
	Using package protection levels
	Restricting access to deployed packages
	Using role-based security for SSIS deployment and execution
	Using execution proxies</p>

<h3>The Life Cycle of a Query in VR</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine (Unreal Engine 4) and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query in VR. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "runthrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. A volunteer at the end will then don an Oculus Rift DK2 Virtual Reality headset and then race through the sections in under a minute to win a prize. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.</p>

<h3>SSIS Performance Tuning with BimlScript</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know that Biml can automate ETL loads, but your data warehouse is several terabytes with a tight load window. In this demo focused presentation, we'll discuss how to use BimlScript to accomplish the following: 
- Dynamically create multiple SISS packages for a data warehouse ETL load, each following a different best practice design pattern. 
- Automatically execute each package multiple times and record the results for analysis.
- Determine which package version should be used in production.   

The only way to be sure that your SSIS packages are performing optimally is to test them against multiple patterns. Make your life easier and let BimlScript do the work for you.</p>

<h3>Mission Possible: Interactive Performance Troubleshooting - Index</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on improper indexing as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!</p>

<h3>SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.</p>

<h3>So what does it really take to get to four nines</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As ones responsibilities grow as a senior Database Administrator many more factors come into play to achieving both the realities and perception of high availability.  The building of professional relationships, managing expectations, helping with setting standards and procedures are all critical components to success.   While some Database Administrator will argue this is out of my scope of responsibilities why should I care about building of professional relationships, managing expectations, helping with setting standards and procedures?  The answer is simple because the perception is that no matter where the process breaks down it’s always a database problem.  Managing customer expectations what do you really mean by 99.99% up time, Translating business requirements to operational realities, commonly overlooked items that impact your 4 nines  Avoiding human errors the realities and perception of high availability.</p>

<h3>The DBA Career Roadmap</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Nobody has a step-by-step plan for your career. But, you do need to know the general direction you’re heading in; which roads go that way (and which ones dead end); and what might be worth stopping for along the way. For example, working for a small shop might be a dead end career move, or it could be a fantastic shortcut to somewhere you really want to be. Getting that next certification might be a worthy way to spend your time, or it might be running around in circles. 

Want to find out how to get to the next great place in your career? Get solid advice from the people who have already been there. If you want to be somewhere in five years, start moving today.

<h3>SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Foreign Keys have a bad rap – they cause performance issues, they inhibit some inserts, deletes and updates, etc.  This may be true, but let’s further explore why we even have them and how they can benefit and maybe even improve performance.  This session will concentrate on many demos including the attributes associated with foreign keys.  The attendee will walk away from this session with a better understanding of Foreign Key utility and their maintenance. </p>

<h3>AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.</p>

<p>I have had a very diverse career that has always been very focused on insights and how they improve performance.  I am currently the Data and Analytics Lead for the Central Region for Neudesic.  

Prior to consulting I was Vice President of Information Services with Mosaic, a retail services company.  leading a forty person team in the U.S. and Canada and architecting a Microsoft BI solution that was accessed by over 1,000 clients from over 140 retailers and retail manufacturers.  Before joining Neudesic I served as the Data Management Practice Area Lead for Slalom Consulting in Dallas.</p>
