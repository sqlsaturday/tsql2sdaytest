<h3>SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deeper Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Transactional replication in SQL Server is not a new, shiny technology. In fact, a lot of people will tell you it's an old one full of nightmares. But don't be too quick to judge; replication still offers a lot of benefits, and  most of the problems you might encounter can be quickly diagnosed and fixed if you have a deeper understanding of replication internals.

In this session, we'll discuss the transactional replication model and what it offers. You'll see plenty of examples of how to monitor transactions as they get from your publishers to your subscribers. There will also be examples of how you can change the behavior of your transactions too, and what benefits (and potential pitfalls) these changes offer.

Finally, you'll see examples on how to configure transactional replication in high availability scenarios.</p>

<h3>DevOps for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
-What DevOps means to the DBA
-What tools and methodologies are important to know
-The future skills you need to build your career</p>

<h3>SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.</p>

<h3>Why should I care about ... the plan cache?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</p>

<h3>Stream Analytics for a SQL Developer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As database developers, we are very familiar with patterns and practices of analyzing data at rest – data that has been loaded into our databases and data warehouses and that allows us to learn what happened a few hours, days or months ago. Yet, we often encounter the need to know and respond to what is happening right now, which requires near-real-time analysis of data in motion.

Fortunately, much of the skillset that we have accumulated in querying data at rest can be applied in querying streaming data with the Azure Stream Analytics service. In this demo-rich session, you will learn the essential architecture and patterns of building streaming analytics solutions and will be introduced to the Stream Analytics Query Language.</p>

<h3>Performance in 60 Seconds – SQL Tricks Everybody MUST Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data and Database is a very important aspect of application development for businesses. Developers often come across situations where they face a slow server response, even though their hardware specifications are above par. This session is for all the Developers who want their server to perform at blazing fast speed, but want to invest very little time to make it happen. We will go over various database tricks which require absolutely no time to master and require practically no SQL coding at all. After attending this session, Developers will only need 60 seconds to improve performance of their database server in their implementation. We will have a quiz during the session to keep the conversation alive. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session.</p>

<h3>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

<h3>How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.</p>

<h3>Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices in Technology</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.</p>

Regardless of the title you carry, DBA, developer, report writer, ETL developer, manager etc., now is the time to make an acquaintance of Analysis Services.  Come, join in as we define basic terms, investigate a few uses cases and see some simple examples.  You will soon see that if data is the new oil, Analysis Services, on-premises or in the cloud, is a key component in the new refinery.</p>

<h3>Word Up: Text Mining in SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Would a database by any other name smell as sweet? 

Our databases are filled with words. By mining our text for patterns and meanings, we can extract the emotional content, track changes over time, ferret out plagiarism, find common phrases and usage, and even predict future text. 

Learn how to dig through your library of language to make your data better.</p>

<h3>SSRS for Developers - attendees choose topics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this presentation, I’ll show over a dozen different SSRS topics, and allow attendees to select which topics to cover. Everything from sparklines to heat maps, from Tablix-drilldown reports to advanced charts, from performance gauges to subreport/drilldown reports to new page/group control features in R2….and even topics like data-driven subscriptions, reports against OLAP cubes, and deploying to SharePoint. There are even topics for integrating SSRS reports into ASP.NET pages, and launching SSRS reports using C#. Since no presentation can cover all the topics, I’ll let the majority of the audience decide which to cover.</p>

<h3>Build Your Extract Packages Automatically!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Automating extract packages is trivial., you simply use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.  The problem is not all your data sources have easy to read metadata like SQL Server.  How do you create usable metadata from these sources? In this hour, I’ll show you how easy it is to make an educated guess on the schema of flat files and other “semi-structured” data sources.  

With that schema, automatically generating your extract package is a matter of seconds!  Join me while I share my interrogator project with you and start saving hours at work today!</p>

<h3>Data Cleansing With SQL And R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>On a given project, data scientists can spend upwards of 80% of their time preparing, cleaning, and correcting data. In this session, we will look at different data cleansing and preparation techniques using both SQL Server and R. We will investigate the concept of tidy data and see how we can use tools in both languages to simplify research and analysis of a small but realistic data set.</p>

<h3>R-ternatives in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft have since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

There are 3 ways you can leverage R in Power BI. You can use it as a data source, you can leverage it in Power Query, or you can use it to create custom visualizations. In this session I present easy to follow examples of those 3 scenarios. I will also provide resources that will enable you to take what you learned to the next level.</p>

<p>Rick is a Microsoft Certified Master with more than 20 years of SQL Server experience in a variety of roles. He currently lives in Washington state and works as an independent consultant providing remote performance DBA and performance tuning services for clients in the USA and Canada. His first exposure to SQL Server was as a database developer, but over time he became more and more interested in how the database engine operated... eventually specializing more on performance issues than code.

Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.</p>
