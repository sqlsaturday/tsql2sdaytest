<h3>SQL Application in Geographic Information Systems</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session relates to the SQL application in Geographic Information System (GIS). ArcGIS software users are using SQL Server 2008 for the advancement of their computing and geospatial decision making. SQL Server 2008 supports ArcGIS users with tools they need to seamlessly use and extend spatial analysis for enterprise-based computing and webGIS development. The use of SQL service in managing the data intensive GIS's geodatabase is very well known. In this session, application of SQL software in geospatial application will be presented with a real world example. It would suggest how SQL application is advancing GIS. The real world application is about a "Tree-inventory WebGIS development for Gwinnett Technical College."</p>

<h3>DBA vs ORM: Strategies for Data in a Code Focused </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft released LINQ, LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework, and ADO.NET Data Services (Astoria) that are a few of many technologies that have dramatically changed how developers think about accessing data. This gives code-focused data access a big endorsement, but what implications exist for the data?  How is authentication/authorization handled?  Is performance good and how does optimization fit into the approach? This session will give an overview of the mechanics of how the technologies work, the pros/cons with the solutions produced, and include a frank discussion of the associated political struggles that may be created from ignorance and improper optimizations.</p>

<h3>Leveraging SQLDiag for Efficient Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the years, Microsoft Customer Service and Support (formerly known as Product Support Services) has developed a number of amazing tools for troubleshooting SQL Server.  Thankfully, many of these tools have been shared with the public.  Trevor will demonstrate the configuration and usage of PSSDiag (for SQL Server 2000) and SQLDiag (for SQL Server 2005 and 2008), which are for collecting a variety of useful diagnostic data.  Then he will cover analyzing the data using RML Utilities as well as a few scripts of his own.  Come and see how these tools can save you massive amounts of troubleshooting time!</p>
