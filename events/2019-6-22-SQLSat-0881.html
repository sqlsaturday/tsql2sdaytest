<h3>What You Need To Know About Processing Tabular Models</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wondered what's happening under the covers when processing a tabular model? Why is it such a resource intensive process? How can I make it run faster? Am I running into a resource bottleneck?

Processing a tabular model can be a very resource-intensive workload and depending on your specific goals (e.g. speed, availability, etc) it may not always be feasible to process the entire model.

In this session, you'll learn what actually happens and in what order during model processing, the difference between the various processing types, performance considerations and most common resource bottlenecks. We'll also cover the most common processing patterns and the associated trade-offs.

Keywords: Analysis Services, SSAS, Power BI</p>

<h3>SQL Server Indexing - Practical Solutions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever created an index on your database to improve performance, and nothing changed? Have you created indexes suggested by the Missing Index DMV or Database Tuning Advisor, and query performance actually got worse? Are you constantly rebuilding your indexes or updating statistics, just for minor, temporary gains in performance? If so, then this session is for you. 

In this session, we’ll discuss how SQL Server selects and uses indexes to improve query performance. We’ll look at how SQL Server chooses a Scan vs. a Seek, why the Missing Index DMVs don’t always give good advice, and how to tell when your databases are over-indexed. We’ll review DMVs and stored procedures that will quickly show how your indexes are being used, and where they can be improved.  After this session, you’ll have the knowledge and tools to properly optimize your indexing strategy and create significant performance gains for your important queries.</p>

<h3>T-SQL : Bad Habits and Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you are a developer, DBA, or anything in between, chances are you might skip some best practices when you write T-SQL. Unfortunately, many so-called “bad habits” aren’t always obvious, but can lead to poor performance, maintainability issues, and compatibility problems.

In this session, you will learn about several bad habits, how they develop, and how you can avoid them. While we will briefly discuss advice you’ve probably heard before, like avoid SELECT * and be careful with NOLOCK, you will also learn some subtleties in SQL Server that might surprise you, how some shorthand can bite you in the long run, and a very easy way to improve cursor performance.

By changing your techniques and ditching some of these bad habits for best practices, you will take new techniques back to your environment that will lead to more efficient code, a more productive workflow, or both.</p>

<h3>Moving Data to the Cloud (with Azure Data Factory)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You need to move data.  A lot of data.  To the cloud.  You’ve got data in a variety of on- and off-site data sources.  There are several ways to do it.  Some of them can be quite easily implemented using Azure Data Factory.  Learn how to use variables and looping in your Data Factory pipelines.  Use the Integration Runtime to pull directly from on-site sources.  See how to upload files to blob storage and import them.  Learn how to trigger Data Factory activities.  And, learn how to keep all those connection strings and passwords secret in Azure Vault.  After this session, you will have tools that you can readily implement in your own data migrations.</p>

<h3>Relational Design Critique</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The process of designing a relational database is not overly complex, and may be done by almost anyone on the development team. The process requires one to take the time to understand the requirements, when they exist, and apply a straightforward set of transforms to produce table structures that meets the needs. The tough part is that the process requires time and experience, neither of which anyone has enough of. In this session, to help the attendee differentiate right-enough designs from overly simple or overly complex designs, we will look at a variety of database snippets, each inspired from a real life design. We will discuss the pros and cons of the approach taken, and consider possible remediations to learn from a failure that was made by someone else.</p>

<h3>Using wait stats to determine why my server is slow</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Server wait stats are a powerful tool that SQL Server gives us that provides insight into why our servers may be running slow. In this session, I will show you what role server resources (CPU, Memory, Network and Disks) play in the big picture of query processing and show you how you can use server wait stats to identify bottlenecks with these. We will also review common server waits that can occur at each crossroads of a query, reasons you may be having them and what you can do to solve the problem. The goal for this session is that you walk away with a better understanding of what wait stats are and how you can put them to use immediately.</p>

<h3>Applying Data Warehousing Principles</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.</p>

<p>On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.</p>
