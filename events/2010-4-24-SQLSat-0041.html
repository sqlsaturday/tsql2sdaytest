<h3>The Art and Science of Data Modeling</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I had a teacher once who told me that creating a great data model is one part science and two parts art.  Boy, was she ever right!  This session will be a look at the fundamentals of creating data models to support your business, both transactional and dimensional (warehouses).  While we're at it, we'll look at some more advanced concepts and how to model your way out of some tricky situations.  

Topics include: 

1) Normalization is beautiful - now let's discuss it in plain English 
2) Raising a well-adjusted database - strategies for creating an adaptable model
3) All Hail Kimball  - dimensions, facts, star-schema, and everything in between
4) Yo Olde Bag of Tricks - patterns and ideas for modeling your way out of sticky situation</p>

<h3>De-mystifying Execution Plan Analysis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Too often the query plan, or how the SQL Server engine actually implements the logical query, is ignored by developers and DBAs.  The reason for not trying to dive into the meaning behind the hyro-glyphic plan is simple: It's not easy to understand what all those icons mean in isolation, never mind as a collection.

This session will bridge the gap between the theory of internals, where the details are mentioned but not demonstrated, and the logical query.  A series of actual query examples will show how queries are treated by the optimizer and why; what to do to identify slow performing queries, and how to make simple adjustments to allow the query to perform significantly better.</p>

<h3>Virtualize This!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the list of features of SQL Server growing constantly the need to sandbox and test drive features in a separate environment that can communicate with but not interfere with your existing environment has become vital. With virtualization, setting up consistent test, dev, and even sandbox environments can happen in minutes instead of hours AND be consistent with previous/ existing environments. In this session we will focus on Microsoft Virtualization solutions that you can leverage starting with your desktop/laptop and extending to your server environments. Even if you aren’t going to be doing the virtualization yourself it’s good to know what your options are.

<h3>Work/Life Balance?  Just A Myth?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many of us started our IT careers in the exact same way: 80-hour work weeks, routine overnight gigs, no life outside the office—this was simply what we considered “normal.” Today, with our careers underway, how do we build a life outside of our IT world? We will share the tips, tricks and tools we’ve discovered and used to create a work/life balance that allows us to feel fulfilled and refreshed outside the office while maintaining our effectiveness as successful data professionals. </p>

<h3>Database Design Patterns </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions. In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.</p>

<h3>PowerShell for the Data Professional</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will learn to perform several everyday DBA tasks like backing up user databases, scripting table objects and evaluating disk space usage with PowerShell. For each task we will explore the benefits of using PowerShell over the standard method. Only a basic understanding of PowerShell or DOS is needed. This session should serve as a good introduction to PowerShell for database users. The goal is to get data professionals feet wet using PowerShell. </p>

<h3>Tuna Helper for SQL Server DBA's</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Transactional Replication</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server replication allows DBAs to distribute data to various servers throughout an organization. Some reasons to employ replication include load balancing, offline processing  redundancy. Transactional replication in particular can offer a very flexible solution where data frequently changes. This session will discuss the basics of planning and implementation of a solid transactional replication solution.</p>

<h3>Wait-Time Based  SQL Server Performance Management</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are many ways to use SQL Server Wait types for performance tuning of a Microsoft database, but often there is confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait event data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait event data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using wait type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Memory Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Like the title says, be prepared to get really down and dirty with memory allocations and usage in SQL Server. RAM is one of the three pillars of server performance and understanding how it is used, how you can analyze what is going on with it and how to properly adjust the the few knobs you have at your disposal are very important topics for both your server's health and performance.

<h3>Why I Use Stored Procedures and You Should Too!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the proliferation of ORM Tools like Linq To SQL, NHibernate, there has been a move to no longer use stored procedures for Data Access, I personally disagree.

<h3>Database Design Fundamentals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently). </p>

This session will describe OData (the Open Data Protocol), the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly. </p>
