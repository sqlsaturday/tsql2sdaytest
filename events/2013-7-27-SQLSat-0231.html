<h3>Leveraging PAL for SQL Server Perfmon Analysis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will cover the Performance Analysis for Logs (PAL) tool in depth. We will cover the best methods for capturing a .blg capture leveraging PAL to find critical performance area. We will also cover creating your own PAL templates. System Monitor has long been a tool used by system admins, DBAs, and other engineers to get a handle on performance issues in their environment. The tool is powerful, but can be difficult to understand which perfmon counters are valuable, to find the correct counters, and to be able to properly view the output. In this session, we will cover how the PAL tool can be used to produce a rich HTML output of your perfmon capture exposing performance risks and trends with full documentation on what the perf counters means to your given workload. We will cover how to leverage existing PAL templates on SQL Server and other technologies. We will discuss how to adjust existing templates and how to create your own template for performance baselining.</p>

<h3>A Balanced BI Approach (Self-Service  Corporate)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>

To bridge the gap from a large requirements process with the risk of functionality lost in translation, I will show you how you can roll out a PowerPivot model for business units in your organization and when it makes sense to centralize it in a BISM Tabular model.</p>
