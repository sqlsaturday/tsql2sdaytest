<h3>I/O Tuning 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2016 AlwaysOn Availability Groups  - Enhancements and New Features</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using SQL 2016 AlwaysOn Availability Groups is a powerful feature which can provide HA support.  
The session will begin with a basic overview of the creation of an Availability Group (assuming the SQL Instances are already installed for time) then I will go into detailed demos of the following features:
  Availability Group Readable Secondary Replicas
      Risks of readable secondary replicas when using a replica that is part of the Automatic Failover pair
      Shared Log Chain Database Impact
  Read Only Routing
       Load Balancing with Read Only Routing (Round Robin)
       What the hell is "Read-Intent Only" and why it is MUCH safer than "YES" 
  Databases with Encryption (why you no longer need a job to set the password every time the SSISDB fails over)
  Multiple Availability Groups on a Single Cluster
  What are Basic Availability Groups (are they still better than Clustered Instances?)
  Automatic Page Repair
and many others
Demos available for download after the session.</p>

<h3>Why should I care about ... the plan cache?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</p>

<h3>The Art of War with Bad Code</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s face it, many of us are at war with poorly written or poorly tuned queries and processes. There is usually just one of you who has been tasked with managing one or more SQL Server instances while there are hundreds or even thousands of users of which a certain percentage will inevitably write poor code. So you must battle it out to identify the culprits before they wreak too much havoc on your systems. We will see several fairly straightforward techniques to positively identify the culprits and allow you to prioritize your efforts in tuning them to give you the biggest ROI for your time. TSQL and Extended Events code examples will be provided that you can use immediately in your environment to become more productive.</p>

<h3>Statistics  Cardinality – How They Work to Find Data Efficiently</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.</p>

<h3>Interrogating your data sources with Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've decided to start using Biml to make your integration services packages. Congratulations! 

Now, you're looking at data sources other than SQL Server. How do you automate package development for these flat files, Excel Files, and other databases?  In this session, I'll share some of the techniques I've used to deal with these second-class sources. I'll be walking you through C# code.  Don't worry, I'm not a real programmer, so the code isn't the most complex, but it does solve the need.</p>

<h3>Securing SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A default SQL Server installation is reasonably secure, but quot;reasonably securequot; doesn#39;t cut it in an era in which one bad line of code, one weak password, or one open port can result in your customer database ending up on Pastebin. In this talk, we will look at different methods of securing a SQL Server instance, from venerable (principle of least privilege, Transparent Data Encryption) to novel (Always Encrypted, row-level security). These tools and techniques will show us ways for developers, database administrators, and network specialists to work together to secure SQL Server instances.</p>

<h3>Indexing 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you a SQL developer, or a DBA responsible for squeezing every last drop of performance out of your instances? If so, few things are more important than a solid understanding of SQL Server indexes. In this session you will learn about index internals, approaches to good index design, and the importance of proper index maintenance. This session starts from the ground up, so it is suitable for anyone wanting to learn more about indexes.</p>

<h3>T-SQL Errors and Problems and Data Meaning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You see it all the time, someone asks a question about how to fix an error like "Subquery returns more than one value" and an immediate answer is given that fixes the syntax. But is that the right fix or are there other things you need to consider when fixing syntax errors in SQL?

I am going to show why it is also important to consider the meaning of the results when fixing issues with a query and why syntax is never enough when querying a database. Along the way I will show you some common errors and problems and the multiple ways they can be fixed and how to evaluate what the correct fix would be.</p>

<h3>SQL Server on Linux for SQL DBA.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For the last 25 years SQL Server DBAs have administered SQL databases using only Windows GUI.
For majority of them even Windows Core is too hard to accept.
In the situation, when Microsoft invaded Linux territory with it's flagship product, as SQL DBA, you must not outsource SQL Server administration to some Linux geeks. 
You can do it yourself!
Your way!
And I show you how to do it.</p>

<h3>Automated SQL Server installation and configuration using PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using the SQL setup wizard and management studio (SSMS) to install and configure a new SQL server is a time-intensive process.  PowerShell scripts can greatly reduce the time required to complete the process.  They can also ensure build standardization throughout your SQL environment.  In this session we will look at PowerShell scripting, including the basic syntax and commandlets needed to automate the installation and post-install configuration of a SQL Server.</p>

<h3>SQL Audit - Evidence Never Lies</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We've all heard about massive data breaches from big name companies. As a DBA, you should consider your company's data to be the most valuable assets. So when a data breach happens at your company, will you be able to provide management with the information? If not, then discover how SQL Server Audit can help provide you with an accurate forensic analysis of who did what to your data. In this session, we'll cover what SQL Audit can capture, how to set it up for both on-premise SQL Servers and Azure SQL Database, and finally produce reports from it.</p>

<h3>Extended Events - Better than Profiler</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008. With SQL 2014, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature. Join me for a little adventure into the realm of extended events. We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration. We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events. This is a fast paced session and will be a lot of fun. Attendees will be able to take back several sample XE sessions to help troubleshoot different issues and get to more intimately know their data/environment.</p>

<h3>Query Store – What is it all about?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL 2016 brings us many new features but one of the most anticipated is surely the Query Store. The Query Store now allows us to track query plans as they change over time giving us a whole slew of new possibilities when it comes to tuning our queries. Even just the ability to compare a previous plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. This session will give you the insight to get started using this new and wonderful feature set.</p>
