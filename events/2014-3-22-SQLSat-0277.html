<h3>Squeezing the Most out of Row  Page Compression</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 brought us the ability to do Row and Page level compression in our databases but even today many people are not taking full advantage of these wonderful features. The most common bottle neck today is physical I/O and SQL Server compression can help with that in most cases. If you are not sure how these features work or how to apply them in your environment this session is for you. We will discuss in detail how the compression schemes work at both the row and page levels along with which data types may or may not be able to participate. We will see from various demos what else affects the compression ratio and just how extensive it can be under the right conditions. Nothing comes for free though so we will also cover the pros and cons along with why, when and most importantly how to use it effectively.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Internals Party: Storage, Memory and the Query Life-cycle</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Come meet the Internals of SQL Server at this special get-together! In this presentation we will cover the basics of data storage and querying with SQL Server. We will cover how data is stored in pages and extents and how that translates to data reads/writes with the storage system. Additionally, we will explore how different queries are processed by SQL Server and how the query life cycle works in general. Finally we will cover disk storage and memory and tie it all together. This session is intended to be broad and to give a general overview of how a query is processed in SQL Server and how storage and memory play a part in that. Everyone is invited to this introductory level presentation and should be appealing to DBAs, DB  BI Developers and System Administrators. Party hats not included, rated G for Geeks.</p>

<h3>SQL 2012 Table Compression</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</p>

<h3>SQL 2012 Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  With SQL 2012, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature.  Join me for a little adventure into what extended events are.  We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration.  We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events.  </p>

<h3>Database Performance Analyzer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you struggling with performance issues and your current tools are not providing answers? This presentation outlines a method for determining the best approach for tuning SQL statements by utilizing response-time analysis. Real-life case studies are used to demonstrate the techniques. Much of what you’ll learn falls beyond OEM, so this is a “must-see” for those who rely on Performance Packs.</p>

<h3>12 Steps to Workload Tuning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We might know how to tune a query for optimal performance or create additional indexes to ensure faster execution, but how do we ensure that our changes don’t hurt our total workload? Have you ever completed an upgrade and wondered if you were truly getting better performance?  Do we know if the new 3rd Party application upgrade will make performance better or worse? In this session, we will go over a process used to tune a workload and answer the common questions above. In this presentation we will also use Distributed Replay, XEvents and ClearTrace to answer these questions and even give you a little insight into how you can document these changes to help you get that next raise.</p>

<h3>Crazy Things That Developers Do</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn what we do (from opening up the database to SQL Injection attacks, how SQL can use Referential Integrity to optimze queries, and the pitfalls of using NOLOCK), why it's bad to the database server (or your career)... and alternatives that can be used instead. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.</p>

<h3>DataViz You Thought You Couldn't Do with SSRS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!</p>

<h3>Data Warehouse ETL Rollback with SSIS 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Loading a data warehouse can be fraught with data quality issues, data type mismatches, and failed loads. To combat these issues and load your data quickly can be a challenge.  This session will explain step-by-step how to implement an ETL rollback framework to remove any data that was loaded incorrectly.  Based on a real-world implementation, this framework can either automatically or manually load the corrected data, making your life easier.</p>

<h3>Administering  Managing the Power BI Environment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI for Office 365 is Microsoft's new self-service BI offering. Just because it emphasizes self-service doesn't mean a system administrator isn't an important role! In this session we will discuss the overall system components and how a Power BI site in SharePoint Online differs from an on-premises SharePoint BI site.  We will walk through how to best handle setting up connectivity to data sources, when a gateway is needed, and what data refresh capabilities exist. We will also consider how and when to create OData feeds from your corporate on-premises data sources, and how those OData feeds affect Enterprise Data Search functionality.</p>

<h3>Treating Tables Like Legos, Partitioning Basics</h3>

<h3>SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.</p>

<h3>Using Expressions to Avoid Three SSRS Annoyances</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As powerful as it is, SQL Server Reporting Services still has frustrating annoyances. Three in particular are: 1) non-queried parameter values must be entered one value at a time, with lots of clicking along with way; 2) the page header and page footer sections cannot contain data regions and therefore cannot display sets of data-driven values; and 3) matrix reports promise the analytical ability of Excel PivotTables but fall short because they are fixed and lack the ability to dynamically slice-and-dice data by values selected by the user. With the expression techniques taught in this session, these annoyances will annoy no longer because you will be able to work around all three.</p>

<h3>How to Write a DML Trigger</h3>

In this session, I will walk through what goes into writing a robust DML trigger, starting with a simple version of a trigger, and working through some very useful applications of DML Triggers..</p>
