<h3>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!</p>

<h3>Unraveling Tangled Code:A Spellbinding Tale of Victory Over Chaos</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!</p>

<h3>Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Deadlocks present a problem to many DBAs.  Deadlocks can be minor occurrences or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a victim like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand basic locking, blocking of SQL Server.  We will review Isolation Levels, and when is an appropriate time to use each.

We will then review Deadlocking, how to capture Deadlocks and touch on how to resolve Deadlocks and lessen the family fighting.</p>

<h3>SS2014/16 In-Memory Tables:  Formula 1 Performance Unleashed?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  Google “In-Memory Tables” and you’ll get a myriad of results from white papers, blogs, webinars, etc.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table

<h3>TempDB- More permanent impact than you think</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a DBA you hear different theories and "gospel truths" about TempDB from many people. Frankly there is no single version of the truth except that if you don't use and manage it well, it will make your life a real h*ll.
What works for you in one situation may not work for you in another situation. What works for a situation today, might not guarantee its success for a similar situation tomorrow.

We will talk about 
Temporary User Objects, 
Work Tables, Interim Results
Version Store for Data
Standards for its configuration
Contention
Data Files Per CPU - Myth or Reality?
Dynamic Growth or Pre Sized?
Trace Flags to Manage Tempdb?
Should we store the entire Tempdb on SSDs?
Should we shrink TempDB or not?

Hopefully at the end of the session your knowledge on Tempdb won't be Temp.</p>

<h3>Advanced Error Tracking for Quick Diagnosis</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we will walk through how to build a detailed error notification service for SQL Server that will trap errors, and email you a well formatted and detailed error report on what went wrong. In many organizations, you typically have SQL agent jobs running, and when failures occur, you get a generic email with a jumbled up message about the error, but it doesn't really help you understand where and at what point did your stored procedure fail.
In this class, we will introduce and go through how to pinpoint errors in real time, and how to identify troubling areas or bottlenecks in stored procedures. In the end, you will have a notification and error handling system that sends you a well formatted email alert with an html table output to show you the events that led up to the error, and what exactly the error was.
This toolset has saved many developers and DBA's tons of time researching failures in jobs, and we hope it helps you too!</p>

<h3>Efficient table design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The importance of proper table design cannot be underestimated. Misconceptions could lead into serious problems not only in terms of database performance, but also it can effect disk space management and interactivity of user interface as well. In this session the audience will have a sensible walk-through of database and table design in detail, encompassing a number of key areas of focus ranging from Data Types to FILESTREAM implementation. Discuss most common a table design mistakes. Find out efficiency of one type over another, IDENTITY vs. SEQUENCE vs. GUID to support PK uniqueness, pros and cons of using composite Primary Key and SPARSE column, and more.</p>

<h3>20 Minute Tabular Model</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you familiar w/ SSAS Multidimensional and curious about Tabular? Having trouble deciding between cubes and tabular models? Then this is your session!

Analysis Services Tabular was introduced back in 2012, and yet it has only just started to emerge from the Proof-Of-Concept phase to a legitimate production alternative in most IT departments. Based on xVelocity, a highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models provide considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. And with major advancements in 2016, Tabular has never been a more appealing solution. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. 

Join me in this session and learn what a Tabular model is, how it fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live step-by-step demo where we'll build and deploy a Tabular model.</p>

<h3>SSIS Unit and Integration Testing with the Open Source BEST project</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Testing is critical to managing a high-quality data lifecycle. Unfortunately, SSIS has no built-in support for test authoring and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered.  

Biml Enabled SSIS Test (BEST) [https://github.com/bimlscript/best] is an open source framework that enables users to define unit and integration tests for SSIS packages using your choice of database tables, Excel files, or XML.

In this session, you will learn how to use BEST to author your SSIS tests and how to use free open source tools to report and visualize test results as part of your existing production processes.

Note that while BEST is implemented using Biml, you do not need to learn Biml to use it.</p>

<h3>Microsoft Data Platform: The Open Space Session</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the last few years, Microsoft has begun to articulate a broader vision of data beyond the flagship product SQL Server.  Azure, Hadoop, HDInsight, R; all of these products have begun coalescing into a platform which will take some time for professionals in the field to embrace.   The big question is: what do we need to know (as SQL Server professionals) in order to be prepared for the onslaught of Big Data?

This session will provide an interactive discussion around the Microsoft Data Platform, to build on our common experiences and knowledge.  As an Open Spaces topic, attendees are expected to participate fully in discussions.  I'll act as moderator, but there's no agenda and only a few slides; the content is completely up to the group.

Experience with other components of the Microsoft Data Platform is appreciated, but not required; the goal is to define "what we know we don't know" and to encourage self-motivated learning plans.</p>

<h3>Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.</p>

<h3>SQL Server High Availability in Azure IaaS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Deploying mission critical SQL Server in Azure IaaS requires an in-depth understanding of storage, virtual networks, load balancers, SQL Server AlwaysOn and more. To qualify for Azure’s SLA of 99.95% availability, steps must be taken to mitigate downtime by leveraging Fault Domains and Update Domains in conjunction with SQL AlwaysOn.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) replaces Azure “Classic” as the preferred deployment method in Azure. New features such as Deployment Templates and Resource Groups introduced in ARM make it a powerful tool in managing the entire life-cycle of SQL Server in Azure.

In this session attendees will learn how to leverage ARM to deploy SQL AlwaysOn Availability Groups and Failover Cluster Instances. Template Deployments and manual configurations using the Azure Portal and Azure PowerShell will be demonstrated.</p>

<h3>Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Finding any IT industry publication that does not frequently reference Hadoop and Big Data is nearly impossible. Even so, to many SQL Server professionals it remains a mystery. 'Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros' is designed to bridge the gap between knowledge of SQL Server and an understanding of Hadoop by comparing familiar features of SQL Server to Hadoop counterparts. Equally important is understanding how Hadoop is different and the use cases in which it compliments SQL Server. Of special note are the ways Microsoft is integrating Hadoop in its data strategy and related products. Perhaps 2016, Hadoop's 10th birthday year, is the time for SQL Server Pros to become familiar with this platform and how to prepare for it's introduction into our work as data professionals.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Agent : All the Knobs You Need to Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a production DBA, do you struggle to schedule heavy jobs to avoid times when the server is already overloaded? Have you ever felt like your end users notice data corruption, blocked processes, or a full tempdb even before you do? And have you ever been frustrated by the fact that Agent never stores quite enough job history to help you troubleshoot job failures? The fact is, SQL Server Agent can do way more than just schedule jobs at a fixed time.  In this session you'll learn how to make SQL Agent run jobs only when ample CPU resources are available, how you can be the first to get notified when data corruption has occurred, and how to use Agent for monitoring data file size issues. You will also walk away with a set of scripts that will help you customize job history retention.  By the end of this demo rich session you will understand how to leverage SQL Agent’s hidden gems that will make your database management job more efficient without requiring additional development time.  </p>

<h3>SQL Phone Home: Teaching Your SQL Servers to Call for Help</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did your backup fail? Was that a deadlock? Did that server just reboot? These are common questions that DBAs are constantly being asked, and DBAs should be asking them of their servers.
 
DBAs need to regularly monitor their servers for a regular health check, and many scripts just become email noise.  It's like the kid in the back seat constantly asking "Are we there yet?"
 
In this session, Microsoft MVP Mike Hillwig will teach you his signature "See Something, Say Something" method. You'll learn how to use the SQL Agent to turn your daily monitoring checklist into actionable alerts. By leveraging the SQL Agent severity alerts and some basic scripting techniques, you'll stop mindlessly going down a checklist and instead have your servers notify you when there is a problem.</p>

<h3>Biml Recipies: Automatically Create T-SQL Scripts for Common Tasks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've probably heard a lot about Biml for SSIS automation, but it can also be used for building complex, yet reusable T-SQL statements for common database tasks – in most cases much faster and more easily than with dynamic T-SQL. This will be a scenario driven session where we discuss many real world examples of manual tasks that can be automated with Biml snippets and the free BIDS Helper AddIn to BIDS/SSDT. You will receive all code for your own use. Scenarios include: 1) Generation of T-SQL merge statements that removes all the drudgery of manually mapping columns - including complex SCD column handling. 2) Stale data detection that uses Biml to create queries that display ranges for all date/time columns in each table of a target database - perfect for retiring tables from WorkDB and other ad hoc environments. 3) Sample data creation that automatically produces test data based on DDL schema information from your data model. 4) And much more</p>

<h3>Incrementally Moving to the Cloud Using Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many organizations are interested in the cost savings, ease of maintenance, and other benefits of hosting data solutions on Microsoft Azure.  For most, moving to the cloud is easier said than done, especially when they have a large existing solution that is being actively used by stakeholders.

In this session, we will examine various strategies for incrementally moving your solution to the cloud. This will include strategies that incorporate the use of:
1) New value-added features and services, such as machine learning and big data
2) Hybrid approaches where portions of your existing solutions can be moved to the cloud without requiring everything to be moved
3) Failover and surge approaches that enable the cloud to supplement on premises resources
4) and much more

Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) will be central to our approach, enabling the rapid movement of assets back and forth between on premises and cloud hosting.

All code will be shared with attendees.</p>

<h3>SSIS Frameworks and Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The material in this session ranges from introductory to advanced. 

Building small, function-like SSIS packages is an SSIS best practice. Biml helps generate lots of packages using design patterns. 

Now you have a bunch of packages - how do you manage executing them? An SSIS Framework can execute packages in a specified order, and it is driven by metadata. Need to make a change in execution order? Execute a T-SQL statement. 

How do you manage the metadata that drives an SSIS Framework? Biml can generate the metadata, as well.

Join SSIS author, blogger, and presenter Andy Leonard for this demo-packed session on Data Integration Lifecycle Management (DILM).</p>

<h3>What is Biml?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>
You've heard about Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). Some people seem to be doing some pretty impressive things with it, but what exactly is it and will it work for you in your job?

Biml is a programming language for creating data warehouse, business intelligence, and other data solutions. It uses XML in combination with small nuggets of C# or VB code to automatically create huge amounts of SQL scripts, SSIS packages, SSAS cubes, and other objects that your team previously had to build manually - usually with slow, tedious, error-prone dragging and dropping. Perhaps the best part is that there is nothing to install on your server - Biml works entirely with your existing data infrastructure.

Want to know more? In this session, you'll find out everything you need to know to get started using Biml.</p>

<h3>A Modern SQL Server DBA...In 10 Minutes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you're a new DBA, or an experienced DBA who's a few years behind, you are probably overwhelmed by all the fancy new terms and features: Azure/Cloud/On-Premises, Power Shell/Query/Pivot/View/Map/BI, Availability Groups, In-Memory/Hekaton, Columnstore, Everything-As-A-Service, and even having to deal with the dreaded NoSQL!

<h3>A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You already know how to write SQL queries against a data warehouse but your new job responsibilities require you to write MDX queries against Analysis Services (SSAS). MDX is the query language of SSAS in multidimensional mode. While SQL and MDX share some common keywords, they have very different syntax and concepts. In fact, the common keywords can be confusing if you are used to thinking in SQL. 
 
In this session you will explore how data is organized in SSAS in a data structure called a cube. Next, we will write MDX queries while comparing them with SQL queries that return similar results. You will see how certain queries are much easier to write in MDX, especially when it comes to querying data that contains hierarchies such as a date rollup. Finally, you will learn how to capture MDX queries generated by Excel and SQL Server Management Studio, to use as practical examples of how to write MDX queries.

<h3>Partitioning Basics: Treating Your Tables Like Legos</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have tables and indexes that have grown really large? Are you moving around a lot more data than you used to? Are your windows for jobs and maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, partitioning may be for you!

With partitioning, you can break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks. It can help you perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. You can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. We’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and full blown table partitioning. We’ll  also look at how partitioning affects things under the hood. Finally you'll see some cool demos/tricks around index maintenance and data movement. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of how partitioning works and know how to make decisions on how and when to implement.</p>

<h3>Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Warehousing made easy with Biml </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>During a recent project migrating from on premise to the cloud. First we were going to Redshift and started coding, then were asked to use Azure DWH instead. We soon realized that moving between cloud providers was actually quite similar, just different names and slightly different code format.

In this session we will investigate several options to migrate your existing solution and the "fastest" way to get your data into the cloud including:
 1) Reusable data export templates
2) Transferring files to Azure Blob Storage
3) Polybase to load data
4) CTAS to Merge data

Can Biml also do AWS S3 and Redshift? Yes and we will show you the similarities in approaches and how we are using it at one of our customers.</p>

<h3>Securing the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Pipeline</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In most organizations, "batch" processing happens at least nightly. Data is moved from one system to another, often with multiple stops along the way. We tend to do a good job securing the endpoints: where the data starts and where it ends up. However, the in-between drops are often neglected. 

In this session we're going to look at typical ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines and consider the weak points an attacker might go after. We're going to eliminate FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) by looking at a few typical architectures, discussing risks at each point, identifying options for protecting the vulnerabilities, and what we've seen typically done (if anything) in practice. While this talk primarily uses Microsoft SQL Server as the example/guinea pig, especially the database engine and SSIS, the discussion will be applicable to any solution.</p>

<h3>Skills Needed to Transition From DBA to BI Architect</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dimensional Modeling is a re-tooling of your existing database normalization knowledge. T-SQL and coding knowledge can transfer to ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) using Integration Services (SSIS). Report Writing has been around for decades and learning Analysis Services (SSAS) can save days of work that custom report writing has taken teams.

Development today requires the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) output. My personal transition from Sr. DBA to DW Architect has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end results analytically. These lessons have molded me into a DW Architect.</p>

<h3>The HA Blueprint for SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server allow applications to achieve high availability (HA) like never before, thanks to synchronous replication technology in AlwaysOn. This capability enables applications to use more resources on more servers, which can significantly improve scalability, performance, and resiliency. But to gain the full value of the SQL Server architecture, you are required to make code modifications at the application or database layers.  Deploying database load balancing software is an elegant way to gain enterprise-grade HA without code changes. In this SQL Saturday talk, ScaleArc will provide a blueprint for achieving HA with SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Architecting virtual SQL server for performance </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today, many enterprise organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications.
