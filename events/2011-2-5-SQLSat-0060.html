<h3>(SSIS, TSQL and MDS) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Match)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSIS and MDS). Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms.The steps are as follows: 1. Cleansing and standardization 2. Group records 3. Split records 4. Compare records and determine scores 5. Split into separate match categories 6. Analyze results of matches 7. Evaluate using match tools to determine if best algorithms have been combined. </p>

<h3>Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>An often-overlooked aspect to data optimization is what is happens under the covers – how does SQL Server store and access data?  There are plenty of common rules covering tuning, but this session looks at data access from the physical layer, detailing how table access and indexes work, showing why some designs perform poorly, and why adding more indexes may not help.  This will not be a discussion of normal forms or design rules. Instead, it will be a technical session providing the foundation for you to choose which concepts to apply to your designs.
  The session starts with the notion that SQL Server is not a magic box – most of what happens is well-documented and must be taken into consideration when designing or tuning databases.</p>

<h3>PowerPivot:  BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The paradox of Business Intelligence:  it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor.  Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us.  Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow?

In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications).  The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :)

I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)</p>

<h3>Gathering and Interpreting Performance Metrics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>To begin tuning your system and the queries that run on it, you must begin from a position of knowledge. The knowledge I’m talking about is knowing what is occurring on your systems. What kind of load is the server under? How many times is that stored procedure called? This session will present the basics of gathering and interpreting knowledge about your server and the queries running on it. We’ll cover a variety of topics from performance monitor, to server-side traces, to dynamic management objects. We’ll go over how to set these things up to monitor your system and how to interpret the data returned from them. This session is part of a full day of training which will be presented in May at SQL Rally in Florida.</p>

<h3>As a DBA, Where Do I Start?!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've always wanted to get promoted into the DBA position. The good news is you got it - the bad news is you have no idea what to do first. What's important, what's not a big deal, and what can get you fired if you're not careful? If your answer wasn’t, “update my resume”, then this session is a good start. We’ll chat about a natural priority for the overwhelming flood waiting in our offices. By focusing on a few words ending in “ity” we’ll realize what is most important. Through the interaction, stories and examples you’ll leave feeling ready to attack your environment. Be warned – along the way to knowing where to start, you may get that feeling in your stomach that makes you log on to the VPN to check a few things out.</p>

<h3>Who's responsible? The vendor or the DBA?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database administrators - you don't really trust your third party software vendors, do you?  Software vendors - you think most of the DBAs out there are hiding things, don't you? Well guess what, you're both right!  Join Erin Stellato (representing vendors) and Mike Walsh (representing customers) for an interactive session where they will tackle some of the toughest challenges that DBAs and vendors face.  Attendees will walk out with a better understanding of what both parties can do to contribute to a successful relationship, as well as a set of fair questions to ask to set the right expectations from the start.  </p>

<h3>Using SQL Azure in an SSMS Addin</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Cloud is fast becoming the latest hot topic in the technology arena.  We need to understand how we as SQL Developers and Administrators can utilize SQL Azure, Microsoft’s platform for relational data storage in the Cloud, to meet our needs.  It doesn’t always have to be full sites deployed to the Cloud, it could also be "hybrid solutions", with a Client tool accessing a Cloud database. That is what will be demonstrated in this talk:  A step-by-step demo of how to obtain an Azure subscription, create and administer a SQL Azure database, and work with it from your own SQL Server Management Studio Addin.  The end result is an Addin in SSMS that uses the SQL Azure Cloud as a common script repository.</p>

<h3>The "Tally" Table  High Speed "Pseudo Cursors"</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are dozens of things we do in T-SQL which require some type of iteration. "Iteration" means "counters", "loops" and recursion to most people. To those well versed in the “Black Arts” of high performance "Set-based" programming, it means a "Numbers" or "Tally" Table, instead. This “Developer-to-Developer” session starts with the basics of how SQL Server can be tricked into counting faster than you can imagine, how that simple act of counting replaces slothful loops and other forms of “RBAR”, and provides a substantial introduction to “set based thinking. The session also includes tips on using Pseudo Cursors, CROSS APPLY, and INLINE TABLE VALUED FUNCTIONS (iTVFs) to make your code that much faster .  </p>

<h3>Baselines first, troubleshooting second</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>“The system is slow.  It was much faster last week!  This is taking forever.”  Statements like these from users can be frustrating for any DBA, unless you have the data to prove how the system regularly performs.  In this session we will cover some of the tools and techniques freely available to SQL Server DBAs for capturing baselines that can be used for measuring performance, capacity planning and understanding usage patterns.  We also discuss how these utilities and their data can be used to identify warning signs and troubleshoot performance issues.
