<h3>Modernizing your legacy database integration points</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Legacy corporate applications that are built in-house can quite often be tightly coupled together. Either you have cross database connections, load jobs, linked servers, multiple copies of data, etc. These design patterns increase your technical debt and application changes will need to carefully consider the impact to the downstream applications. Tightly coupled databases can also make migration/upgrade projects more difficult, especially as you start to looking towards cloud based solutions.   
 
What if your organization has started to implement newer design patterns and technologies like microservices, restful web integration or enterprise service buses? Do you have to re-write all of your legacy applications to use these new technologies? 
This presentation will show a method that was used to update legacy applications to utilize an integration middleware platform without a major re-write of the application. We will then expand on this and show how your SQL Server database could</p>

<h3>Blue Collar SQL Tricks - Make Standard Edition Work for you.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You want Enterprise Edition of SQL Server? Not gonna happen!  When we are limited by having just the Standard version we have to dig into our “Blue Collar” roots, we need to become more creative and squeeze every penny it has to offer out of it.

In this session, we will review some of the limitations that Standard has.  Then review items such as basic normalization and  High Availability options available to Standard.   You will also learn Blue Collar techniques to implement partitioning using techniques like as indexed views and partitioned views.

Let’s dig in and learn to make use of all we have until we beg our bosses enough to get Enterprise Edition!</p>

<h3>DBA Checklists: Reliable, Repeatable,  Automated.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Now that SQL Server loves PowerShell and Microsoft loves open source, it is even easier to automate even your most time-consuming, repetitive, mundane or burdensome tasks.

Using the DbaChecks PowerShell module released at the SQLBits 2018 conference we can:
    Track SQL Server instance configurations
    Promptly provide required information to managmement, change configuration or developers
    Deftly respond to audit change requirements across your entire estate (and impress your auditor with PowerShell;)
    Restore SQL Servers to their correct state prior and post deployment
    Test *everything* from configuration to permissions, SQL service account share access to sysadmins, Agent Jobs to SPNs
 
This session will look at how to install and use this module . With multiple examples we will look at both running the checks and viewing the data in the supplied PowerBI reports.

Pre-requisites
Some basic knowledge of PowerShell and DBA</p>

<h3>SSIS Sucks!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you are involved in data warehouse development using the Microsoft technology stack, then you have been introduced SSIS.  The question you will have asked yourself many times as you develop is: "What the #%@ were they thinking?".  This session is dedicated to providing an overview to some of the items that just drive you nutz using this tool in an enterprise environment, and having a laugh while we learn.

From tiny windows designed for a 640x480 monitor, to clicky-clicky-clicky madness, to the tool being anti-agile.  Developing and maintaining code with SSIS is enough to turn your hair gray early.  But it sure looked "snazzy" when your boss got a demo of it, so now it is your problem.

So if you are a seasoned developer come on out and commiserate with the community, and if you haven't used to tool yet you can find out what your boss is asking you to get involved with.

Either way this will be a fun presentation that I am hoping you won't soon forget.</p>

<h3>Columnstore Index Primer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Overview of Columnstore indexes introduced in SQL Server 2012 and its evolution through each release.

<h3>Azure Data Catalog – Turning Unused Assets into Usable Knowledge</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is today’s currency. Azure Data Catalog (ADC) is a relatively unknown resource in the IT community.  This is an unfortunate state since ADC is an incredibly useful tool that is easy to implement and use. Companies that are able to leverage their data have seen the greatest gains in growth and market capitalization.  The reason for this is simple: We live in the information age.  Being able to leverage the data you gather is the invitation you need just to compete in information age.
ADC is an indispensable tool that helps companies organize and make sense of the mountains of data they collect every day.  By walking participants through an implementation of ADC, I will introduce them to the product, and show how easy it is to use.  By presenting concrete examples of how ADC is used, I will demonstrate its importance. Participants should leave this session determined to introduce ADC to their team and resolute in their intention to implement it within their company.</p>

<h3>DBATools! The reason to finally start learning and using Powershell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Powershell has been part of Windows for > 10 years and has been part of SQL Server since 2008.
In spite of this the adoption among Database Professionals for use in investigating and managing their environments has been low.

With the release of the open source DBA Tools module from DBATools.IO, with its 300+ commands, the time has arrived for Database Professionals to embrace PowerShell and upgrade their skills to support the modern Hybrid environment.

In this session we will look how to download, install and begin using the power within both this module and Powershell.

No prior experience with Powershell required!</p>

<h3>R For the SQL Server Developer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is the premiere language for data analysis.  If the world of data science sounds fun and exciting, now is the time to get into R.  We will walk through the core constructs of R, learn how to retrieve data from flat files and databases, and get a peek at the power behind R.  This session will also give resources on where to go in order to become more familiar with statistics, R the language, and the R package ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Service Broker</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Restoring service broker from a live system to a test system can give you strange results.  From messages that refuse to send to messages that appear to send but never arrive.  We will be troubleshooting using SQL profiler and some DMV’s to see what goes on in the background when service broker is misbehaving.  Nothing more worrying than performing a disaster recovery and having service broker messages not send.  We will also be doing a quick overview of what Service broker does and what is required for a service broker setup.  Once we have shown the profiler method of diagnosing problems, I will show a quicker and easier way to find and resolve service broker issues.</p>

<h3>Back to the Future with Temporal Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Back to the Future is the greatest time travel movie ever. I'll show you how temporal tables work, in both SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, without needing a DeLorean. We cover point in time analysis, reconstructing state at any time in the past, recovering from accidental data loss, calculating trends, and my personal favourite: auditing. There's even a bit of In-Memory OLTP. There might even be time for demos!</p>
