<h3>Why are we Waiting..</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>An in-depth session examining "Waits" happening in your SQL Servers, using the well-known "Waits  Queues" methodology. 

With particular focus in the session on understanding and interpreting the information found the (DMV) sys.dm_os_wait_stats, 
Taking note of which “Waits “with the highest counts or excessive wait times, as well as those which “Waits” can be safely ignored, 
We can discover those "performance hurdles" and ways to overcome or remove them, restoring your SQL Servers performance levels. 
By using established methodologies like “Waits  Queues”, we can systematically identify and remove performance

<h3>SQL Injection from website to SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Injection is still one of the biggest reasons various websites and applications get hacked.
The solution as everyone tells us is simple. Use SQL parameters. But is that enough?
 
In this session we'll look at how would an attacker go about using SQL Injection to gain access to your database, see its schema and data, take over the server, upload files and do various other mischief on your domain.</p>

<h3>Welcome to the Licensing Nightmare </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are You remember "Sliders"? In my opinion Licensing World is similar to this series. How many time You tried to understand licensing? How many times You heard different opinions about same question? I'm sure, that You know what is CPU, CORE, SOCKET. Are You familiar with Processor / User / Device? And CAL / SAL/ SA too? Are You use SPLA program or just OEM or MOLP? Physical Instance, Virtual Instance, 90 Days, EULA, SPUR, LAR, Multiplexing, 5 Dollars (not 5 Cents)... It's not all the possibilities, if we are talking about licenses. Let's talk about it, from the Licensing Point of View

<h3>ETL Shootout, SSIS vs Powershell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking, Powershell is not an ETL tool. And you're probably right.
But I keep running into weird requests that were just easier to fix with Powershell.
I'll show you why some things are not easy in SSIS. 
I'll also discuss how you can work around a lot of that instead of switching to Powershell like I did.
This session will be around 70% "why is this hard in SSIS and can you work around it?"  and 30% "Look how cool Powershell is"</p>

<h3>XML: The Marmite of SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A basic introduction of SQL Servers XML Capabilities, it will cover access of XML using .value and exist with variations of XPATH that can potentially improve the queries, explaining Typed and Untyped XML and cover the use of Primary and Secondary Indexes with XML and how these may (or may not) affect performance, and considerations to take before using XML at all.</p>

<h3>Cloudbursting - Amazon RDS for SQL Vs SQL Azure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We all know about the low startup costs of using cloud based SQL Servers, but what are the (hidden) costs and benefits?

In this session, we will run thought the supported feature sets of each and how they stack up against one another.
Does one perform better than the other? Are they better for different work loads?

If the demo gods are with us, will can see they both in action and you can see for yourself!

<h3>An Introduction to SQL Server Virtualisation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Virtualisation is a hot topic at the moment and the chances are your business is probably looking at or already implemented virtualisation to some degree. As a DBA there will be pressure for you to virtualise your SQL Servers too.  Many DBAs are reluctant to virtualise their SQL servers usually because of the fear that that performance will suffer. If virtualisation is done properly though SQL Server will run perfectly well on a virtual platform and you may even get some added HA benefits thrown in for free.</p>

<h3>SQL Sever, the DBA  Compliance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Compliance is something that we are all having to deal with and this is only going to increase with heightened privacy concerns and due diligence requirements in business. This session will cover three of the main areas that you are likely to have to deal with; Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX) and the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). I will look at what these standards are for and how they sometimes conflict.

Information Heavy and Demo Light, this session will help you identify what you need to keep an eye on and I will show a couple of options on how to monitor who is doing what with your data.</p>

<h3>Myth Busters! Busting Common TSQL Myths</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will take a look at, and hopefully bust, my list of common myths and misconceptions I see and hear about on a daily basis. 
We will look at areas such as Indexing / SARGability, joins  sub queries, nested views, query plans and a host of other myths. Using lots of a demos and examples attendees will walk away with a better understanding of the best ways to use TSQL and hopefully bust at least one myth or misconception that they have </p>

<h3>Database Replication - What, How and Why</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database replication doesn't get much attention, especially now that the AlwaysOn features have been released into the wild.  

However, replication offers another way to make data available on multiple servers/locations that steps outside of "normal" HA/DR scenarios.

This session will explain what database replication is, what the different parts are that make up the replication architecture and when/why you would use replication.

The content will be valid for all versions of SQL Server from 2005 onward,</p>

<h3>Natural Born Killers, performance issues to avoid</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ll learn simple tricks to write better code, scripts, and tables. Plus, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of common database development and administration mistakes, and how you can avoid them.

Plus, you’ll learn how to take corrective action when:
•The optimizer isn’t using all available processors 
•The database engine fails to report all the resources a query has used 
•The optimizer uses the wrong plan 
•Database tables cause memory issues

<h3>A temporary fix for a short term problem </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Finding the best way to implement complex logic in TSQL can be more challenging then you’d expect. Often, the developer just makes the query bigger and more complex but this is not always ideal. We’ll look at how and when you should split larger queries into smaller chunks. We’ll explore the implication of larger queries, using temporary tables, table variables, functions and view, derived tables and sub queries and CTEs.

<h3>READPAST  Furious-Transactions,LockingIsolation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you really understand SQL Servers’ Concurrency behaviour?
Are you sure that Transactions are an ALL or NOTHING operation?
Do you believe Read operations cannot start a Transaction?
Do you really know if READ UNCOMMITTED is safe for reporting?
Is being Optimistic really better than being Pessimistic?
Can SQL Server 2012 be the solution to all our problems or our worst nightmare?

I look forward to you joining me in this very revealing and thought provoking session where I will provide answers to all these questions and more and make you wish you had known all of this sooner.</p>

<h3>Tracking server activity without slowing it down</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>All SQL Server DBAs should know how Service Broker and Event Notifications work so that they can implement this very simple feature to make sure they are aware of events happening on their servers. 

Event Notifications is a very light-weight, asynchronous mechanism for identifying events and taking actions. In this session we will create sessions to monitor for and act on DDL changes, file size changes, index and statistics changes, security changes and more. Attendees will gain an understanding of how they can monitor many servers and stay in control.</p>

<h3>Estimation, Statistics and “Oh My!”</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>At the heart of SQL Server is the cost based optimizer.  Stop and think about that a minute, it attempts to give the “best plan” based on the cost of the work undertaken.  How does it know the cost of the work before its done the work ? This isn’t a conundrum, it doesn’t.  It estimates!  How does it estimate ? That is statistics.
This will be a deep dive into how the optimizer makes its decisions to give you a plan, the things that can go wrong and how you can have influence over these choices.

<h3>Quantifying the cost of Compression</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A DBA running SQL Server 2008 or above will often need to understand if it is worth trading CPU cycles for I/O by enabling row or page compression. The benefits can be significant, but does the cost in core licensing offset the storage capacity saved? Often, comparing the workload before and after compression isn't an option. How then can you make an educated guess about the cost of compressing tables and indexes?  In this session, we will use Grade of the Steel type workloads to quantify the CPU cost of enabling different types of compression. Using CPU profiling, we will try to quantify the cost of this feature.</p>

<h3>Thinking Big  Understanding PDW</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you design and build Data Warehouses? Are you interested in learning about big data design challenges and how you can avoid them? Would you like to know more about Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW), MPP Architectures and Microsoft's Big Data Platform? If so then this is the session for you.

We will visit the architectural components of PDW and look at some of the new features available in V2. We will also dive into some of the lessons learned developing systems for PDW in the field.

You will leave this session understanding why you should be thinking about PDW for your data warehouse and how you can accelerate the delivery of your PDW project.</p>
