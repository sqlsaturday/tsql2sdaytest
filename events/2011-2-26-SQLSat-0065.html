<h3>Processing Flat Files with SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats. You’ll also see how to produce complex output formats.</p>

<h3>Do You Know the Data Flow?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Data Flow task is one of the most powerful and most complex tools available in SSIS. Whether you are brand new to SSIS, or you’ve been using it for a while, it’s likely you’ve had some questions about the Data Flow. Why are some components so much slower than others? Why can’t I store a value (like a row count) in one component, and use it in another component later in the Data Flow? And why does it always seem to be the part of my package that fails when I run it against real data? Well, you’re not alone. During this session, we’ll answer these questions (and many others) by learning how the Data Flow operates internally. After attending this session, you’ll know a lot more about getting the most out of Data Flows in SSIS.</p>

<h3>Data Warehouse ETL with Integration Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft designed Integration Services with ETL processing for Data Warehouses in mind, so loading one should be pretty easy. It's not that bad, but there are a few things you should avoid and non-obvious best practices to use to make that ETL faster and more reliable. This session will explain how to accomplish Kimball style ETL using SQL Server Integration Services. We'll review the SCD Wizard and how it works for processing your dimension tables - and what alternatives you have to it. We'll also examine fact table loading using a surrogate key replacement pipeline. Finally, we’ll look at specific and easy performance tweaks, techniques and best practices that apply directly to DW loads.</p>

<h3>Through the Looking-Glass</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There" - When your world is SQL Server, you need a looking-glass to determine server health, diagnosis problems, and tune performance.  In this session will we follow Alice through the looking-glass to determine what she finds in SQLServerLand.  Alice will be using dynamic management views and functions (DMVs) to explore the land behind the looking-glass.  She will find statistics, poorly performing queries, and much more.  Follow Alice and her new friends, as she traverses across SQLServerLand and provides you with snippets of T-SQL code that you can use to explore your own SQLServerLand.</p>

<h3>Is That A Failover Cluster On Your Laptop?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>ver the years, one of the most common questions I am asked is, "How can I configure a cluster on my machine?" Ask no more! Production should never be the only place you have clusters. Having the ability to create a cluster that you can use as a sandbox for testing or as an instruction tool for presentations and demonstrations is something every DBA should have in their arsenal.This session will demystify the "magic" behind configuring a cluster on your laptop or desktop using either Vmware Workstation or Microsoft's Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 R2, and show how to configure things like the virtual machines, the domain controller, and the iSCSI storage solution.</p>

<h3>Lies, Damned Lies And Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wondered what the things called statistics are, why they're important and what needs to be done to maintain them? If so, this session is for you! In this session well take a look at what statistics are and why SQL keeps them; at how SQL maintains them and under what circumstances that maintenance is insufficient; and well look at the problems that result when they are inaccurate. Finally well cover some suggestions and options around maintenance of statistics when the automatic maintenance is not sufficient.</p>

<h3>Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services (BI)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.</p>

<h3>SQL Azure - Cloud Database Coolness</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What is SQL Azure and why should you be interested in it? What benefits can it have for your company? This session will discuss what SQL Azure is, why you should be looking at it, and how to work with SQL Azure. We will discuss deployment scenarios, briefly discuss how to develop applications for SQL Azure, including OData, and how SQL Azure can help face constant infrastructure challenges and demands.

<h3>Virtualization and SAN Basics for DBAs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>These two technologies can make a very big – and very bad – difference in how your SQL Server performs. Wouldn’t it be great if you could get the real, honest lowdown from a virtualization administrator, a SAN administrator, and a DBA? Wouldn’t it be even better if one person had done all three, and could give you the pros and cons of each point of view? That person is Brent Ozar, a Microsoft Certified Master who’s been there and done that.</p>

<h3>Become a Bilingual DBA! Oracle for the SQL Server </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In today's enterprise environments, it is becoming increasingly necessary to integrate data from a variety of sources. As SQL Server continues its march into the enterprise, the days of focusing 100% on one platform are over. At a bare minimum, we need to be able to communicate with DBA's for other platforms. Terminology as simple as Instance and Database mean very different things in Oracle than they do in SQL Server. In this session, we will compare and contrast the two platforms in terms of features and terminology. We will also discuss some of the best practices and pitfalls when integrating the two.

<h3>Introduction to Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you heard about these things called indexes, but aren't really sure what they are or how to go about using them? If so, this session is for you.

We'll start with the basics of what an index is and why SQL likes them and look at some general guidelines for creating useful indexes, ones that will make your queries lightning fast.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

<h3>No More Bad Dates: Using Temporal Data Wisely</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Temporal data can be confusing in SQL Server. It's no wonder: there are six data types for storing these values. In this session we'll discuss dates, times, and how they are stored internally. We'll talk about how to select a temporal data type and common issues with some types. We'll compare performance of different methods for computing temporal values. We'll also take a look at gotchas in features of SQL Server for which date and time data type choices can be critical. Choose wisely: the correct type and high performing data access logic will help your applications scale and save development and administrative time.</p>
