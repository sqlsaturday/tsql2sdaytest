<h3>An IoT/BI/AI session - from Raspberry Pi to Power BI and lots in between</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session Ben will walk you through a home-made IoT project with the data ultimately landing in Power BI for visualisation. A Raspberry Pi is the IoT device, with sensors and camera attached to give an end-to-end streaming solution. 

You will see Python used to run the program and process the images. Microsoft Azure plays its part where Microsoft Cognitive Services enriches the images with facial attributes and recognition, Azure SQL stores the metadata, Azure Blob storage holds the images, Power BI visualises the activity and Microsoft Flow sends mobile notifications. You'll see enough to walk out and get your own project started straight away!

This is a demo heavy session and audience interaction is key!</p>

<h3>Execution plans ... where do I start?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That's where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it's slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.</p>

<h3>Azure Machine Learning for the absolute beginner</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Machine learning is one of the hottest trends on the market. According to the popular belief, machine learning will help you do everything from water your plants to help run your multi-million dollar company. Some of the hype is true, much of it is false.  But what IS machine learning - really? How can it be used? What questions can it answer? Har hard is it to get started?
Join Alexander for a session that will give you a thorough overview of what machine learning tools are available in Azure, how to actually find any use for machine learning, what preconceptions are wrong and how to get started on your first machine learning project.</p>

<h3>Don't Bite Off More Than You Chew - Take It in Chunks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Any SQL programmer with some experience knows that loops are bad and that you should work with all data at once in set-based statements. However, you may have experienced situations where this strategy did not work out well and you ran into problems like out-growing the transaction log or blocking other users.

You can solve this by operating on the data in chunks. Implementing chunking is not that difficult, but there are still pitfalls you can run into. In this session, I will discuss in what situations you may want to use chunking. I will give some best practices for how to implement chunking for good performance and I will highlight some things you need keep in mind, for instance, recovering from interruptions.

I will also look at how you can use chunking for error handling: You want process many rows and you want the good rows to succeed even if some rows yield errors - something you cannot do in a single set-based statement.</p>

<h3>Practical Adaptive Query Processing in SQL Server 2019</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>An improvement of cardinality estimation is something we try to find in every next version of SQL Server. Even with all the improvements the SQL Server 2014 Query Processor gained, we still need to deal with Hash and Sort Warnings, extremely high or low Memory grants, or the well-known User Defined Functions performance issues. That’s why we are so existed to find the new wave of adaptive query processing improvements to handle the more intractable cardinality estimation issues that often result in a poor query performance. Join me in this demo rich session to find what’s in Adaptive QP for you and how it affects your queries and workload. You will find answers of questions like is there a reason to migrate my database to SQL Server 2017 or 2019, what it will bring for my workload.</p>

<h3>A Game of Hierarchies: Introduction to Graph Processing with SQL Server 2019</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Hierarchies are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Bill of Material
* Calendar and Time
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are mostly sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are usually modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. SQL Server 2017 brought us Graph Database and the MATCH clause and SQL Server 2019 comes with further improvements.
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.</p>

<h3>Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.</p>

<h3>End-to-end monitoring for a successful Power BI implementation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Implementing Power BI in your organisation is more then allowing people to download Power BI desktop and publish reports to the Power BI Service. People have to be aware of what Power BI is able to achieve for them! But how do you know who is creating what? Using what? Or maybe even more important, sharing (confidential) information with others? 

With a Power BI end-to-end monitor you will be able to monitor all Power BI content allover your tenant. These actionable insights will help you to see who needs some extra help, but also in governing your data solutions within your organisation. 

In this session I will show you which insights you will get with an end-to-end monitor and how you can monitor your own Power BI environment.</p>

<h3>ABC's of the Power BI REST API</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will be looking into managing our Power BI content using only the Power BI REST API. While the Power BI REST API is extensive, we will be limiting this session on the following sections of interest: Dashboards, Datasets, Reports  Groups.
	• How many Dashboards are there in a workspace?
	• Which Datasource is this Dataset configured to use?
	• Who is allowed to see this Report?
	• Can I take ownership of this Dataset?
	• How do I resfresh my Dataset?
	• Is my Dataset refreshing on a schedule?
	• ...
Those are just some of the questions we will find the answers to.

Examples will be provided in Powershell, which may require minute skills up front. Not to worry, a quick intro will be provided as well.
Attending this session will make you familiar with the Power BI REST API and provide you with guidance on how to manage the most common tasks in Power BI.</p>

<h3>Applying Agile in Business Intelligence</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will be discussing the merits of Agile processes in Business Intelligence (BI) development. 
First of all the focus will be on explaining the differences between Agile methodology and Waterfall processes in BI and why Agile is here to stay. 
Agile requires a specific mindset in BI projects due to being full stack and we give pointers on what rules can make your communication with the business more fluent. 
This will include the value of maintaining live documentation for both business and developer.
We then look at technical limitations for implementing Agile that are specific to BI and how to overcome these. 
Following this, we can describe how we're pragmatically going to apply these principles, and elaborate on splitting up the scopes in a project (staging, Data Warehouse, and reporting layers). 
By the end of this session, you will have a better understanding of Agile development in BI, and some tools of how to apply this to your day to day operations.</p>

<h3>The Microsoft Power Platform - What is it?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>May I introduce you to the Microsoft Power Platform!? 
This new term was introduced by Satya Nadella and James Philips as the serving foundation for building powerful (cloud-baked) applications. PowerApps as the data manipulation part, Microsoft Flow as the connecting workflow engine and Power BI for analysis and reporting. In addition, the Common Data Service (CDS) and the Common Data Model (CDM) provide a solid framework for data storage and modelling.
Join me in this session if you want to get an overview about the involved technologies, how they work together, see them live  working together in many demos and how they will definitely change the way of building powerful solutions in the future!</p>

<h3>Not just polish – How good code also runs faster</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I want to show you how just a little neater and tighter code can also run a lot faster. These are some of the instant performance improvements that won’t change a lot of code, won’t generate weeks of testing and validation for your colleagues, and can be relatively quick to implement.

But most of all, they’ll make the code prettier and easier to understand for the next person.

We’ll look at common ways that null values, implicit datatype conversions and foreign key constraints can radically affect the performance of your queries. Inspired by an actual client case, where I tuned a 20 hour query down to a few minutes, with only a minor code change.

This presentation is all-code, some execution plans, and no-powerpoint.</p>

<h3>ETL with Azure Databricks, The Complete Introduction</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Databricks seems to be the new sheriff in town. It promises easy but capable ETL (amongst other things). But how does it work? For an SSIS (and possibly BIML) person this all looks new and strange. Python notebooks? Scala? Spark? What is all this, and where do I start? Well, you start by coming to this presentation. We’ll take a look at how to approach making an Azure Databricks based ETL solution from start to finish. Along the way it will become clear how Azure Databricks works and we will use our SSIS based ETL knowledge to see if it can handle the common use-cases from our daily jobs. And of course we will also have some fun and see how fast it can go!</p>

<h3>SQL Server database perfomance on Azure, Google and AWS cloud platform</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The popular image of cloud services is both attractive and enticing. Your systems can run seamlessly at peak performance anywhere in the world, and It is natural to assume that the performance of cloud services is identical and stable, regardless of whether it’s located.
To confirm if this is really the case, a series of performance tests were conducted on Microsoft SQL Server in three different locations and on three different cloud platforms: Azure, AWS and Google. We also compeer the results, from three Azure Service tiers (Basic 5 DTU, Standard S3 100 DTU and Premium P2 250 DTU) with previous tests from December 2016 and March 2018.

We will present the test methods and the results and findings.
Based on our measurements we have seen:

-	Significant variations in performance between the different geographical locations
-	Significant variations in performance for the same database at different times
-	Surprisingly poor performance of Azure Basic and Standard tiers</p>

<h3>Azure Machine Learning Services and Kubernetes – Taking models into production</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>On December 2018 Microsoft announced the general availability of Azure Machine Learning Services. This component contains many advanced capabilities designed to simplify and accelerate the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models. In combination with Azure Kubernetes Services it has never been easier to facilitate everything from development to operation for machine learning models within Azure.

In this session we will go in depth in both components with demos from a machine learning project from Bane NOR. We will also discuss different Machine learning framework in Azure, and how Azure stands as a Machine Learning platform compared to its biggest competitors.</p>

<h3>First steps with SQL Server on Docker</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Containers are gathering more and more attention. Wherever you take a look at - you have them. SQL Server 2019 introduces Big Data Clusters that utilise Kubernetes to orchestrate SQL Server, Spark and HDFS containers. Starting with SQL Server Express 2014 each next version of SQL Server is available as a Docker container. If your contact with containers technology was somehow limited - it's time to change that.
 
Join me in the session where I will introduce you to the Docker containers world. You will see their phenomena and will take a look at how you can start using them in your work. During the hour we will start from the beginnings, through use cases, to configuring custom SQL Server environment within minutes and starting it in seconds. We will focus on SQL Server, but also take a look at the other applications.</p>

<h3>SQL Injection: What Is It, Prevent It, Monitor For It!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will explain and demonstrate exactly how a SQL Injection attack occurs. While the core vulnerability is easy to understand, exactly how hackers exploit that vulnerability is not. I'll show you how a hacker explores your database through SQL Injection to find vulnerabilities and sensitive data. Better still, I'll show you the errors that this exploration generates, providing a mechanism for monitoring your systems to identify SQL Injection attacks. Finally, I'll show you the steps you should be taking to properly secure your systems in order to completely avoid SQL Injection attacks. SQL Injection is considered the primary vulnerability for most systems today. Learn how to protect yourself and your organization.</p>

<h3>Building Dynamic Data Pipelines in Azure Data Factory</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You already know how to build, orchestrate, and monitor data pipelines in Azure Data Factory. But how do you go from basic, hardcoded data pipelines to making your solution dynamic and reusable?

In this session, we will dive straight into some of the more advanced features of Azure Data Factory. How do you parameterize your linked services, datasets, and pipelines? What is the difference between parameters and variables, and when should you use them? And how does the expression language and built-in functions really work?

We will answer these questions by going through an existing solution step-by-step and gradually making it dynamic and reusable. Along the way, we will cover best practices and lessons learned.</p>

<h3>Use Docker to Deploy SQL Server Applications</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Docker can not only be used for testing purposes, but also for deploying applications. The big advantage for the customer of the application is that nothing has to be installed, there are no obstacles to the application running in the given environment etc. because the environment is defined by the developer. German Data Platform MVP Frank Geisler will show how all of this can be achieved by using docker. There will be plenty of demos in which all the necessary steps will be shown.</p>

<h3>Making Managed Instance Perform, a dive into storage.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Moving to the cloud means that we need to take a different approach when it comes to how we design and tune databases. Managed Instance is a case in point, get the storage configuration wrong and it will not perform. Together we will look at the storage options and architecture for Managed Instance before demonstrating how to get tune the storage layer to get the performance we need. Of course none of this is any use without knowing what level of performance you need so we will look at how you can get this information before you start testing.</p>

<h3>"Can I join you?", one table asked the other</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you have your database beautifully set up according to Codd. What do you need when you have to retrieve data from related tables? Most probably a JOIN operator, but which one?

Fom LEFT to RIGHT, when is it INNER and when OUTER? Is a CROSS JOIN something NATURAL? And why may ANTI yield more results than SEMI...? How and when do their buddies MERGE, HASH and NESTED LOOP get to participate? 

We'll have demos for all of this on well-known databases. And if all that doesn't make your head dizzy enough, I might even throw in some CROSS and OUTER APPLY.</p>

<h3>Continuous Intelligence... What's this all about?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Continuous Intelligence combines the terms of Continuous Integration and Business Intelligence and aims for defining and implementing processes to keep your implementation and deployment processes for your BI applications flexible and as seamless as possible.
Even in the near past support for CI processes of BI projects was almost not there. But the last few years brought some changes to the perception of this topic and shifted the mindset.
Let's look at advantages and challenges for CI in BI and at possibilities to implement such a process for Analysis Services.</p>

<h3>Azure SQL and Automation, how to keep your database up-to-speed in the cloud</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>While the typical DBA role is being assigned to mission-critical databases, we developers, still need to plan for some basic database maintenance.
