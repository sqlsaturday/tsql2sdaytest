<h3>Transactional Replication: Beyond The Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Transactional replication can support synchronizing from as few as a hundred to as many as hundreds of millions or more of changes a day across multiple servers. However, replication is more than clicking your way through wizards; Monitoring and tuning are required to achieve optimal performance and the number of processes involved increase the likelihood that problems can (and usually will) occur. This session is for DBA already familiar with the basics of transactional replication and looking to go beyond the setup wizards to gain a deeper understanding of the technology.  We'll cover monitoring techniques, calibrating performance, and troubleshooting common replication problems plus share some tricks and tips.</p>

<h3>Database Design Fundamentals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently). </p>

<h3>The Dirty Dozen: PowerShell Scripts for Busy DBAs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For DBAs PowerShell provides a simple but powerful way to automate everyday tasks.  This session walks you through a dozen scripts to simplify and easily automate time-consuming and tedious elements of your day to day job.  This isn’t stuff you’ll use SOMEDAY, these are scripts you can use when you get home tonight.  Harness the power of PowerShell to easily find Servers short on space, Script out tables and constraints across all of your databases at once. Backup databases and restore them to a different environment. These tricks and many others will allow PowerShell to simplify your job like no other tool.</p>

<h3>As a DBA, Where Do I Start?!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you are new to the role of DBA, being "forced" to take on its responsibility or joining a new company with previous experience, knowing where to start can often mean the difference between success or failure. In this chat, Mike will help us wade through the noise that attacks a DBA and figure out just what our priorities should be. By focusing on the "itties" of Database Administration (Recoverability, Availability - Health  Performance - , Security and Reliability) we can see a natural priority form. Throughout this interactive discussion we will also look at some of the available tools and scripts to help see where our environments rate. Mike emphasizes our role as "Protector of the Data" as a DBA throughout.</p>

<h3>Planning your ETL architecture with SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poorly planned and executed ETL project will inevitably lead to maintenance nightmares, low reliability of the system, or worse yet, to the failure of the project. 
In this session, we will use ETL best practices to make a requirements checklist you can use in your next ETL implementation, and will demonstrate  how you can use SSIS to implement and meet  such requirements. If  you already learned the basics about SSIS and now want to take your ETL solutions to the next level, or if you became an SSIS developer/architect by accident and wonder what do you need to succeed, then this is the right session for you.</p>

<h3>Automate Login Administration  Compliance Reports</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are your internal auditors asking that the administration of SQL Server logins be handled by a third party other than the DBAs? Is your Compliance and Audit departments asking you to determine if password policies are being enforced, who are sysadmins on your servers, who owns databases? If so, come to this session to learn how to complete these tasks quickly and efficiently using PowerShell and SQL PowerShell Extensions (SQLPSX).  </p>

<h3>DBA Script Thumb 2010</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>

<h3>Moving Data with SQL Azure and SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Azure allows you to host your data in SQL Server in the cloud. That provides some big benefits in scalability and management. However, it leaves open the question, “How do you get your data into / out of the cloud?” At some point, you are going to need to move data to or from an on-premise store to SQL Azure. In this session, we’ll discuss the available options for this, including SSIS, the Sync Framework, and BCP. We’ll cover the pros and cons for each. We’ll drill into one of the options, SSIS, in detail, and review performance options and potential issues that you may encounter when doing this.</p>

</h3>
<p>Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQLSaturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.
