<h3>I know what you did last transaction: Auditing using CDC, Temporal Tables and Triggers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Attendees of this session at SQL Saturday South Florida 2018 voted to recommend it for SQL Saturday Orlando! There have been more advancements in the topic of auditing SQL inserts, updates and deletes during the past few years than in the nearly 30-year history of SQL Server. Eric Berkowitz presents a fast-paced, live demonstration and comparison of Change Data Capture, the new SQL Temporal Tables and conventional trigger-based methods. Gain the ability to audit, research and report on data changes, without recoding existing applications and proactively plan for auditing in new systems. Understand the overhead and performance implications and storage and retention options for each approach. See how querying, DDL changes and compatibility considerations vary among the methods so you can make informed decisions about implementing auditing in your system.</p>

<h3>Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.</p>

<h3>Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans..the Ola Way!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.</p>

<h3>Everything You Need to Know About SQL Server Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You probably already know that indexes make your queries go faster. But do you know all the different types of indexes in SQL Server and when to use them? Also with each new release of SQL Server, there are new features that can impact how indexes function and are maintained. Finally, knowing how the different types of indexes work can help you make better indexing choices when tuning your queries.
This presentation will review current SQL Server index structures and options, discuss how they work, when they should be used and how to maintain them. Examples of all the index types such as hash, in-memory, columnstore, filtered, etc… will be shown.
This presentation is a must see for DBAs, Developers, Application Architects and anyone else who is interesting in maintaining high performance SQL Server applications.</p>

<h3>Creating Reports and Dashboards with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session looks at both Power BI Desktop and Power BI.com to compare the advantages and capabilities of both platforms for creating and distributing data analysis within your organization.  It will also touch a little on why you might choose Power BI over Power Pivot and why you might not.  It will also look at how to create drill down detail screens to expose the details behind your visualizations.  Finally, we will touch on how to publish your Power BI results for others in your organization to share.  A basic understanding of database structures and referential integrity is an advantage to gain the most from this session, but as will be shown, not always necessary depending on the source of the data to be analyzed.</p>

<h3>Deciding to keep your BI Data Platform On-Premises</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The world is going to the cloud and there is plenty of good reason for it, but NOT every IT workload should go to the cloud and your BI is no different. Maybe you aren’t ready, maybe your organization feels fully invested in your current On-Prem infrastructure. Maybe there is some fear of the unknown.

The speaker will tackle these challenges and help you, the attendee, understand how and when to decide to stay On-Premises or move to a Cloud or a Hybrid solution. As an attendee, you should have the information to comfortably determine what is right for your organization today, and have a plan for the future.

Attendees will understand what On-Premises benefits are available exclusively to them
Attendees will understand where Cloud and Hybrid solutions complement their existing deployments 
Attendees will be in a better position to explore moving beyond their On-Premises deployment</p>

<h3>Twitter Data  Sentiment Analysis: Staring Logic Apps, Azure ML, Twitter Data, Power BI, and Python</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A year ago we went to Spider-man: Homecoming.  On the way home I thought “I wonder what the rest of the world thinks of this movie?  I wonder what people on Twitter are saying?  I wonder if this is that tied to box office performance?”  Over the last six months we’ve been building data sets on movies and collecting sentiment analysis of Twitter data.  This lead to a journey of data discovery.  First to figure out how to capture and analyze social media data from Twitter.  Next we needed box office information.  After that we wanted to capture sentiment.  Then we wanted stock market data.  Then we wanted movie information, runtime, rating, Metacritic score, IMDB score, and then how do we get historical data if we want to increase our data set?  Once you collect the data how do you store it?  How do you display it?  All this and more….. but probably just this….because that’s a lot.</p>

<h3>The Changing Role of CIOs and the Value of DevOps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps practices are a powerful tools to build productive, engaged teams who constantly learn and regularly deliver value to their customers. High DevOps performers report greater workplace satisfaction than their peers. But implementing DevOps isn’t a matter of being great at writing code, or choosing the right technologies: to become a high DevOps performer, you need the powerful catalyst of executive support. In this talk, we will discuss the value of DevOps from the perspectives of CEOs, CIOs/CTOs, and Managers. We will explore how the role of CIOs and CTOs are undergoing a major transformation, and how DevOps aligns with that transformation. You will leave the session with a fresh take on how to discuss DevOps with company leaders, and an understanding of how to explain the value of DevOps to people in these roles.</p>

<h3>Tally Ho! -- Explore the Varied Uses of Tally Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Because SQL Server is designed to efficiently operate with set-based queries it does not perform as well with loops and cursors. However there are situations where you really need some type of a loop. Tally tables give you the best of both worlds by allowing you to effectively "loop" through records in a set-based manner.  We'll explore what tally tables are, how they work, and more importantly review some of the many ways you can use them to turn your loops and cursors into efficient set-based operations.</p>
