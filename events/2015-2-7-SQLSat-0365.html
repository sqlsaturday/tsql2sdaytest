<h3>Visualizing performance tuning data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Just staring at the output from for instance sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats is usualy not very helpful. Creating delta's from the data and then representing it as a graph helps to understand that data. Over the years I've tried various ways to look at output from SQL Server for performance tuning reasons. In this session I will share a couple of them with you. We will look at virtual_file_stats, waitstats, the buffer cache etc. and we will visualize them in various ways to make it easier to draw conclusions. The visualisation techniques vary from simple graphs that combine throughput and latency to more complicated scenarios that I saw being used by Formula 1 on tv, which translate well to Waitstats and Buffer pool cache usage.

<h3>Automate your Data Profiling insights using Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data profiling is a critical input task to any database initiative that incorporates source data from external systems. With the right data profiling, it’s possible to gain a huge amount of insight into the data quality in your systems, and as a result, be able to make radically more accurate estimates of the cost to go from the "as is" to the "to be". The Data Profiling task in SSIS can be very powerful, but it is tricky to use and time consuming to review the findings, until now. 
In this session I will demonstrate how you can automate data profiling of any SQL Server Database using Integration Services, and use the output of the data profiling task to populate a Power Pivot data model. 
This data model can then be used to analyse table structures, data quality and identify problems with your data. By using the different profiles you can determine how to clean up your incoming data prior to loading it into your database.

<h3>The Care  Feeding of Analysis Services in Production</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A lot of the information you'll find on Analysis Services is focused around the initial creation of databases and models, but once you have a solution deployed to production then what?

In this session we will look at what it takes to run an Analysis Services server in production. What are the basics that you need to know about how the server works. Including things like threading, memory usage and locking. How can you monitor the health of your server? What tools can you use to find out what's happening on your server? We'll have a look at what you should be monitoring to make sure your system is running properly and run through what to investigate went things don't run as smoothly as you'd like.

<h3>How to build an Activty based modelling system with SSAS Tabular and Power Pivot</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The ability to distribute costs, including overheads, to activities in an organisation allows profitability to be calculated down to an individual activity, hence the ability to calculate the *real* client and product profitability.

In this session we take a look how you can create an Activity Based Modelling system using SSAS Tabular for the allocation model, and Power Pivot (over the Tabular Model) for end-user reporting.  Having the final report model in Power Pivot gives the end user the ultimate control over reporting, including adding other information possibly not even held with Information Technology.

I'll show you an example health care model where we replaced an expensive, difficult to understand and maintain SAS system, with a simple elegant solution (auditable) based on the Microsoft stack. The rules are table driven with allocated costs handling built in.

Having build the model with one of the finance team power users, they now own and understand the new system.</p>

<h3>Power BI - Beyond the Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI is a Microsoft's self-service BI platform for both on-premise and cloud-based data. It enables business Power Users to make the most of their data by using the new data discovery, analysis and visualisation features in Excel and Office 365, in an easy to use environment that they are already familiar with.

In this session we will go through the main features and capabilities of Power BI using an end-to-end scenario. We will also discuss best practices and tips along the way that will enable you to get the best out of this exciting technology.

Topics include: Overview, real-life demo, hybrid-cloud scenarios with Data Management Gateway, DMG tips and tricks, custom map demo, QA tips, licensing overview, Power BI roles in an enterprise environment, how this could fit your organisation, lessons learned from our 1.5 year journey, etc.  </p>

<h3>10 Handy Tips On SQL Server Dates</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you working with an application supporting different time zones and international date formats? How does your choice of storing date / time values differ if you are using Windows Azure SQL Database instead of on-prem SQL Server database? Did you know that SQL Server Database Engine, Integration Services (SSIS) and Analysis Services (SSAS) all have slightly different date / time data types? How can you bullet proof your system for the ever growing data in your organization with much more date and time data to come?  
 
With time being the one thing that constantly changes, date and time calculations are widely used and essential to all business transactions. Yet, most systems only use one or two date data types; Is this a wise decision? Quite often data retrieval relating to a period of time does performs poorly, or worst of all, is not accurate. These 10 tips will help you bridge the gap, and provide the techniques to build bulletproof systems the users demand and DESERVE! </p>

<h3>Thinking Out of the Box: Manage SQL Server Using Built-in Tools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s often the case that your budget doesn’t stretch far enough for all the great third party tools that help manage your SQL Servers. So, how can the in-built components of SQL Server help you with your daily tasks?

Policy Management, Data Collector and Extended Events, all included in both Enterprise and Standard Editions, provide a framework to keep your configurations consistent and give you some insights into the performance of your SQL Server instances. In this session, we will see how to make use of these components to formalize your configuration and track some performance attributes.

After this session you’ll be able to build out an effective management and monitoring toolkit using only “out-of-the-box” features.</p>

<h3>TOP GUN SQL SERVER: Why piloting jets and flying SQL Servers requires similar psychology!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A DBA - Why piloting tactical jets and flying SQL Servers requires similar psychology and composure to ensure mission success during emergencies!

Let's face it, being a DBA is a stressful job.  Your performance in production environments matters greatly, even on the easiest of days. But when things go wrong, that’s when you really earn your money and discover the depth of your knowledge and your poise in emergency response.  

This training focuses on improving your successful handling of critical situations.  Content is based upon the collective knowledge gained by many people over many years in high performance aircraft.  Nick will share examples of how to, and how not to, handle stress in extremely difficult situations.  We will look at tried and true techniques that will help DBAs perform better when there is an actual emergency.  You will also learn about the teamwork and crew coordination often required to handle time-critical scenarios.

<h3>Building Hybrid BI Solutions with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As organizations look to lower infrastructure costs and increase worker productivity, two industry trends have emerged: the shift to the cloud and self-service. How will these trends change the way we build BI solutions, without compromising on security, manageability and governance? Join this session and find out!

We will explore the following questions: What is Power BI? What do you need to run Power BI? How does Power BI differ to traditional BI? Where does Power BI fit in a broader enterprise BI strategy? And, finally, how can on-premises data sources be used in cloud-based Power BI solutions?

In addition to answering these questions, we will build a Power BI solution from scratch using both on-premises and cloud-based data sources. We will use Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View and Power Map, before deploying the solution to a Power BI site in the cloud, and interacting with it using Q  A, the new natural language query technology.</p>

<h3>Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SSIS development time. During this hour long presentation, Peter Avenant from Varigence Australia will use the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and use to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session will be largely demonstration driven, and reusable sample code will be distributed for you to use in your own projects. Using a live-typing approach, Peter will start from scratch and by the end of the session create a full-blown staging environment. This will include the creation of *hundreds* of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment just by changing the connection strings - or make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.</p>

<h3>Perception, Heuristics  Visualisation Cues</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s the end of the day you’re tired – there’s no shame in that.  Still, your presentation needs to make an impact so that the audience understands and remembers your content.  How do you display that data so that it is effectively absorbed?

This presentation looks at the display mechanisms for information.  We delve into our visual cues and our cognitive patterns to understand how our minds interpret what we see so that, when we choose a graphic, we can choose the most effective visualization for our content and meaning of information being presented. 
 
We look at which visualization techniques work and why less is sometimes more.

<h3>Using Azure Machine Learning to Predict Melbourne House Prices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>House prices are a topic of conversation at every BBQ and dinner table across Melbourne.  Have you ever wondered what drives house prices or wanted to predict an outcome in advance?  This interactive session firstly introduces the What, How  Why of Predictive Analytics and then provides an overview of using Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) for making predictions in the context of Melbourne House Price data.  The session explores using Azure ML regression algorithms and other statistical techniques to build an Azure ML experiment to first discover what features influence prices and then builds an Azure ML predictive Web Service solution based on those features.  In the process of learning Azure ML regression, and with a bit of luck, we may even come up with a model that works!</p>

<h3>A Few Of My Favourite Query Plan Operators</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Without feeling any need to resort to any kind of Julie Andrews rendition... 

Query plan operators do all the work when you run a query, and some of them are more significant than others. You may have learned about Seeks and Lookups, and about different Join operators, but when I look at a plan and see certain operators, some of them convey a lot more information than you may realise. This talk will look at operators such as "Merge Join (Concat)", "Top N Sort", "Filter", "Hash Match (Distinct Sort)", and more, exploring the significance of some of some of their properties, and helping you raise your game when it comes to performance tuning.</p>

<h3>Are You Safe from Prying Eyes?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In our connected society, there are many avenues by which databases can be accessed by unauthorised people from both inside and outside your organisation. Even if your database does not contain sensitive information, it can still be damaging to your organisation if it is leaked, so care must be taken to ensure that both your SQL Server infrastructure and the data stored within the database has been appropriately secured. In this session, Jim McLeod explores the features available for encrypting data, securing the database instance, and options for auditing who has been looking or changing your data.</p>

<h3>MDX, it is not that hard!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>My first experience with MDX was: good, it looks like SQL: SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE. On my second glance it turned out to be completely different than SQL. But after a while SQL and MDX started to feel similar. In this session I bring you to the point of seeing the similarities instead of the differences. We will use your SQL experience to give you a head start with MDX. The session is also good for those with a bit of experience who want to know a bit more about the background. Of course all theory is backed by demo’s.</p>
