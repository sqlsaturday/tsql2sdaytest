<h3>Read Committed Snapshot Isolation - The Real Implications</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>To reduce lock contention and deadlocks, and to provide repeatable reads application developers often want to use the Read Committed Snapshot Isolation (RCSI) database option. While most DBAs understand this has some implications for TempDB usage and have vague ideas about Page Versioning and Version Chains in TempDB, most have little knowledge of the significant implications, and problems that this option can cause.

This session demonstrates the impact of RCSI on Transaction Control, TempDB and database performance. It demonstrates what happens under certain error conditions and how to identify and resolve problems arising from RCSI related issues.

This is for the DBA who wants to gain an extra level of understanding and the tools to identify and resolve RCSI related issues. Not for the faint of heart.</p>

<h3>Diving into data - Swimming in the Lake. A look at Data Lake.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s Globally Distributed, Multi-Model database service.  Transparently scaling across multiple Azure regions, Cosmos DB provides for many API’s including MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin and SQL. It offers multiple consistency models and guarantees uptime or 5 9’s.
Azure data lake provides a way for a whole range of different data to be stored, analysed and manipulated – all form a single place – so that developers, data scientists and data analysists can access it. Forming part of what is often termed ‘a modern data warehouse’ this technology is something that is becoming more common.
In this session we’ll take a look at these two technologies and how they might be useful – either now or in the future.</p>

<h3>Developing Cosmos DB for the Enterprise</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Cosmos DB is an awesome multi-model database service that allows us to distribute our data on a global scale. It's fairly easy to get started with Cosmos DB, but when it comes to implementing it for use within our Enterprise applications, there are many things that you will want to consider when developing a Cosmos DB database.

In this session, I'll cover important topics that you'll want to consider when developing and administrating Cosmos DB for Enterprise use, including security considerations, partitioning, provisioning throughput for your databases and collections, distributing your data and much more.

By the end of this session, you should be able to take these learnings and apply them when developing Cosmos DB applications for your business.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Azure Analysis Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>They say every cloud has a silver lining, well this one is gold! This demo heavy session will introduce you to Azure Analysis Services. We begin by looking at a traditional analytics platform, and how this fits into the "modern data warehouse". This session will guide you through the processes (and pitfalls) of modernizing your data analytics solution. Still using PowerPivot models or for that matter still using SQL Server Analysis Services on-premise? Let's see how to leverage these assets into the modern would of cloud computing using Azure Analysis Services, with minimal downtime. Prepare to be amazed at what is possible with all the wonders of cloud computing in the Azure world.</p>

<h3>Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. 
It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 
TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.
In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 
A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.</p>

<h3>A Generic ETL Framework</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As data specialists, data integration projects are some of the most complex environments we have to deal with. In particular when it involves data migration.
There are many tasks that need to be performed, ranging from data profiling, data quality assessments, master data management, testing, to the standard ETL processes. We often wind up reinventing the wheel, especially because most of these projects are one-off throw aways. These make our lives that much harder as we are often pressed for time by the business to get on with the job.
In this session, I would like to show you how a generic ETL framework can help save us time by leveraging off some standard processes that can easily be developed and reutilised.
I will show you how with a few simple SSIS tasks and lines of code we can create an efficient ETL process that we can keep using again and again. Because it's extendable, we can easily add additional components for DQS, MDM and reconciliation testing.</p>

<h3>Beyond Devops - Introducing Data Reliability Engineering</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today’s database professionals must be engineers, not just administrators.
We build things. We create things. As engineers practicing devops, we are all in this together, and nothing is someone else’s problem. 
As engineers, we apply repeatable processes, established knowledge, and expert judgment to design, build, and operate production data stores and the data structures within. 
As database reliability engineers, we must take the operational principles and the depth of database expertise that we possess one step further. 
Guiding Principles of the DBRE 
* Protect the Data 
* Self-Service for Scale 
* Elimination of Toil 
* Databases Are Not Special Snowflakes 
* Eliminate the Barriers Between Software and Operations</p>

<h3>Things I've learned from working with Data Scientists</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Imagine you have data in SQL Server and you engage a data scientist to work with the data and return back additional information like score and prediction.
They work their magic and create a solution in a Jupyter notebook which they run through and execute on their machine.
My first thought is, wow how cool, followed closely by what's a notebook? And how do we operationalize this and have it automated to run on a server and not needing a human to run.
In this session, I'll take you through my journey from the notebook to running on a server via ML services in DB and all the parts in between.
 - Jupiter notebook
 - SQL Server machine learning in DB
 -- how to install
 -- check setup
 -- adding additional python modules
 - how to run python scripts using sp_execute_external_script</p>

<h3>SQL Server Upgrades and Migrations - The Right Way</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There has been lots of focus recently on upgrades and migrations with the end-of-life of SQL Server 2008 and 2008R2.

With so many critical databases running on these older versions, how do you ensure that you achieve a successful and safe transition to your new platform? Fortunately there are some fantastic tools and defined processes that can lead you through each stage. 

There are tools to test different versions and infrastructures, processes to track query regressions and provide a way to remediate them.

This session will walk through the upgrade process from end-to-end and show what tools can help you at each step.</p>
