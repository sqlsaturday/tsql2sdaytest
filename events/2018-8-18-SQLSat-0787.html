<h3>A Rocket Scientist Perspective on Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance!  Performance!  Performance!  That’s what the rocket scientist and SQL Developer are looking for.  Indexes can offer significant performance benefits, but can also be a detriment to overall database performance.  This session will focus on a deep dive into clustered indexes (including B-tree traversal), Primary Keys, and non-clustered indexes, their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering non-clustered indexes will also be examined in detail with emphasis on when and when not to use.  Included will be many live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using statistics and query plans.  Some knowledge of TSQL and Management Studio is recommended.</p>

<h3>Extending DevOps To SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!</p>

<h3>Data Protection  Privacy in the World of Database DevOps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ensuring the ongoing protection of personally identifiable information is mandatory in today's business, helping you to guard against data breaches, and comply with the GDPR. In a climate where cyber attacks are all too frequent, and data is spread across a growing number of different environments, the challenge of protecting your data can seem daunting.  This session will address the implications of the GDPR on database management, and demonstrate a privacy-first approach to controlling and protecting data as it changes and moves through your SQL Server estate. As well as offering guidance for assessing your data estate for GDPR readiness, this session will include some great tools and tips for building data protection and privacy into your development processes, and dispel the myth that database DevOps and compliance can't go hand in hand. With the right preparation, you can build compliance into your processes, keep sensitive data safe, and deliver value quickly to your end users.</p>

<h3>The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is no organization that is immune from performance issues with their SQL Server queries. Sometimes all it takes is one "perfect storm" that kills your server performance and lands you in the hot seat with everyone asking you what happened. While many performance issues can be addressed with an index or configuration change, what about when the root of the problem is the code itself? Whether it's a stored procedure or dynamic T-SQL generated by an ORM, the burden of proof lies with the DBA to demonstrate how the code is negatively impacting performance. 

How do you capture those bad queries? When you have this data what do you look at besides the query itself? How do you make the case to the business that a code change is necessary? In this session we will explore capturing and identifying those problem queries, the analysis of the performance data, and how to effectively communicate your findings to the business to get your proposed code change approved and implemented.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Databases in the Clouds</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Application servers or services running on a cloud platform now have many options for their database engines. We discuss the various alternatives for providing Microsoft SQL Server services to cloud-based applications, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Google GCE, and multiple options within those environments.  Why would you choose one approach over the other? What are the trade-offs on cost, performance, availability, security, ongoing maintenance, required skill sets, etc.</p>

<h3>Let's Explore SQL Internals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how SQL Server stores your data?  With so many ways that it can be done, we couldn't possibly cover everything in this session, but we'll discuss the fundamental building blocks that SQL uses to organize data into usable units.  We'll also see how we can peek under the covers to actually view some of the strutures involved.  Why?  Because understanding how the pieces fit together will help you to design better, more efficient databases and tables, as well as providing knowledge of a critical component of how the SQL optimizer comes up with query plans.</p>

<h3>An (Advanced) Introduction to Dax</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Coming from the Excel world, DAX can look like Excel formulas on steroids. However, to be successful with DAX and Powerpivot, you'll need a completely different mental model. In this introduction to DAX, we won't spend too much time on the basics. Instead, we'll focus the concepts that make DAX unique. This will help you avoid the stumbling blocks of working with DAX. We will cover calculated columns, measures, aggregations, filtering, and iterators.</p>

<h3>Looking through the Windshield: Forward-looking Dashboards  KPIs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It is dangerous to drive forward while looking through the rear window. The same is true about guiding our organizations forward while looking only at the past. Yet, much of our BI shows only the past. This session explores simple techniques to make our dashboards and KPIs visualize what is likely in the future. No fancy predictive algorithms are necessary – just an appreciation of what we know about our organization’s future and a recognition of past trends that are likely to continue. Examples are provided in Power BI, SSRS Paginated Report and SSRS Mobile reports.</p>

<h3>Intro to Powershell for the SQL Server DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many DBA's have the same outlook on Powershell - we all know we should use it, but we don't think we have time to learn one more tool that isn't even really part of SQL Server anyway.  I was one of these DBA's for many years, but recently I have come to respect the *power* of Powershell.  Come learn the basics of Powershell, how Powershell and SQL Server interact with each other, and finally how to use Powershell to automate common SQL Server tasks such as maintenance and SQL Server installations.  If you need to interact with Windows or Active Directory, odds are Powershell is the right tool for the job - come learn how to use it!</p>

<h3>JSON for the Data Mortals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you see curly brackets stored in your database and wonder what that is? Are you a DBA, with developers storing JSON in your database? As a database administrator or developer, it's important to understand JSON today.  This session will explain what JSON is, where it came from, and why it is showing up all over the place.  When you leave this session you will understand how to investigate, manipulate, and validate JSON in your database.  You will walk away with example code of how to use Microsoft’s additions to SQL Server to use this data.</p>

<h3>Difficult Queries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Take your T-SQL skills to the next level.  Regardless of your current level there will be something here you'll be glad you didn't miss.  Basics like avoiding cursors in iterative tasks and multi-database executions are the tip of the iceberg.  If queries are basic arithmetic then this is basic algebra.  First we see how coding style affects maintainability then dive into several types of encapsulation, parameterization and tricks with values, cross apply, pivot and more .</p>

<h3>Mom Rules for Managing Enterprise Database Environments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever looked at an environment and wondered how the heck they ever got anything done because it is so disorganized? The first thing I do for newly inherited environments is implement some organization and do some database clean up.  Not only does organization make the environment easier to maintain, it can help speed up trouble shooting.  Good organization can even help with some performance issues.</p>

<h3>Learn History from Temporal Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.</p>
