<h3>Automated Restore Script Output for Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is designed to be useful to two different audiences:
1.Those implementing Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution for the first time. (Or don't even know what the Maintenance Solution is!)
2.Those that have been using it for awhile, but might have a hole in their DR plan – what to restore when a resource goes offline.

We will do an overview of the maintenance solution to start, then get down and dirty with the guts of the extension. What I am presenting is a custom extension that works out of the box for jobs created using the maintenance solution. The scripts will add an additional job step to all DatabaseBackup jobs which will output a text file that contains the most current restore scripts for each database in the instance.
If you don't know what I just described in that last paragraph, you should come to this session and that will be explained as well!</p>

<h3>What is new in SQL Server 2016 for DBAs?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 was released in June 2016 with tons of new features. When Service Pack 1 was released in November 2016, many of the Enterprise level features were allowed in lower editions of SQL server 2016. Microsoft made sure everyone got something out from an upgrade to SQL Server 2016. In this session, you will get an overview of several of the new features in SQL Server 2016. It will cover Dynamic Data masking, Row Level Security, Always Encrypted, Temporal tables and time permitting few more goodies. This is a high-level overview session on advanced features of SQL Server 2016 and therefore we will not be going deep into any one technology. My goal is to inspire you to take action and play with new features of this great product.</p>

<h3>Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.</p>

<h3>How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.</p>

<h3>Navigating Modern BI Infrastructure – Power BI Report Server (On-</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business Intelligence has sat pretty comfortably on the same laurels for well over a decade however that landscape has been disrupted by the surfacing new Azure tools, Power BI, and now Power BI on premise. With so many new tools and features, things can get pretty intimidating, especially for those with additional considerations and regulations. It can, however, open new doors to organizations who were previously unable to fully utilize BI.  Through presentation, demo, and open discussion we attempt to navigate classic BI Architecture and the available options there in, as well as touch upon the future of BI and modern architecture.</p>

<h3>Set Me Up: How to Think in Sets</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is optimized to work in sets, but this is certainly a paradigm shift for someone accustomed to row-by-row operations.

We will look at T-SQL features that can break set-based processing -- generally meaning poor performance -- and gather empirical evidence to support that assertion.  We'll also look at some constructs to overcome these issues and make your T-SQL scripts run faster and use fewer resources.</p>

<h3>Dammit Jim! Dr McCoy’s Field Guide to system_health (and the default trace)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As DBAs, we are asked all sorts of impossible questions.  Who dropped that important table last month?  Why was everything slow last week?  Who made that user a sysadmin?  You’d have to be a mind reader to know the answers to some of those, right?  Not necessarily!  SQL Server can help you find information about these and other common problems with its default trace and system_health Extended Events session, but you have to know how to collect and interpret the data they provide.  In this session, we’ll explore what system_health and the default trace are, what information they contain, and how to use them to find the answers you’re searching for.</p>

<h3>Learn History from Temporal Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. They are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allow us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code and without using any behind the scene triggers. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. It has lots of demos and less theory.</p>

<h3>Protecting Your Data with Encryption</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We’ve all seen the recent news stories about companies whose data has been stolen by hackers.  What was once a rare event has become all too common, and companies large and small are at risk.  While it isn’t always possible to prevent intrusions, you can reduce the risk by encrypting your data.  In this presentation, I’ll show you the four ways that SQL Server provides to encrypt data: hashes, cell-level encryption, database-level encryption (also known as transparent data encryption), and backup encryption.  We’ll also discuss the keys required for each type of encryption and discuss how to protect the keys themselves.</p>
