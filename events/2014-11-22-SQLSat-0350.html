<h3>Implement a Dynamic Table Partitioning Solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have a large or potentially large database that you would like to partition?  Manually implementing partitioning and the corresponding maintenance can be a lot of work, especially if you have many tables.  In this presentation we look at how you would implement a partitioning solution dynamically for all tables with the designated partition column.  We set it up to keep a FIXED number of file groups.  The partition maintenance will recycle the file groups over time as partitions are dropped and created.  We do as much as possible through dynamic scripting.  This solution can easily be used for archiving but in this example we are simply keeping the most current 6 months of data and dropping the rest.  Assumes you have a basic understanding of SQL Server table partitioning.</p>

<h3>Analysis Services Terms and Concepts for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Despite some overlapping concepts, the worlds of the Relational engine and Analysis Services really are quite different. With more and more organizations realizing the power of Analytics, there is a good chance a BI initiative will come your way at some point. 

This session is intended for the DBA that wants/needs to learn more about SQL Server Analysis Services. The goal is to provide a meaningful base of knowledge that will allow you to effectively participate in discussions of Analysis Services in your organization.

Through both slides and demos, you will learn:
-- The differences between SSAS Multidimensional and SSAS Tabular
-- Key terms like Measures, Dimensions, Hierarchies
-- Storage options such as MOLAP, HOLAP, ROLAP, and Direct Query
-- Monitoring with Extended Events
-- Overviews of MDX, DAX, and XMLA
-- and more

Come take a few steps into the exciting world of Business Intelligence with SQL Server Analysis Services.</p>

<h3>Breaking Data - How to Load and Stress test your database using SQL Profiler and OStress</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will present how you can load and stress test your SQL Server database using SQL Profiler and OStress. This session will review how to performance test Extract, Transform, and Load SSIS processes, application SQL code, Reports, and free-roaming SQL. We will share SQL Profiler templates that help to trap the poorly performing SQL statements that can then be using to stress test your database until it breaks. In addition, we will show how SQL Profiler can be used to extract the SQL submitted by SSIS and Object-Relational Modeling tools like Hibernate and then use that SQL to take stress testing to the next level.

The first third of the presentation will be presentation style and the following two thirds will be demonstrations where we try and break the database with our stress testing. All this with a Breaking Bad theme!</p>

<h3>Twice in a Lifetime: T-SQL Refactoring 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether it's because you inherited the code from the "last guy," or your stored procedures haven't been looked at since the database was created in 2001, there will come a time when you need to rewrite old code. When you start this project you may ask yourself, how did I get here? And you may ask yourself, how do I work this? This is not my beautiful database. This is not my beautiful T-SQL. Letting the data go by, information flowing to the end users is the goal. Refactoring old code can be tedious, but necessary. Sometimes it isn't just about identifying the worst queries in your application, but figuring out how to rewrite everything to introduce the best practices that the last guy didn't know about five years ago. 

This session will cover ways to quickly find old T-SQL antipatterns, tools that can help make things easier to update code, and deprecated features that can't be used in modern versions of SQL Server. Don't leave your old T-SQL the same as it ever was.</p>

<h3>10 things I wish I knew about loading data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session I’ll share some of the lessons I've learned the hard way about loading data.  I’ll show you some ways SQL Server Integration Services can make your life easier (or harder!) and ways you can move data without ever leaving SQL Server management studio.   Want to move data like a boss Monday morning?  This session will show you how!</p>

<h3>SQL Inejctions and How To Stop Them</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL injections are a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into a SQL statement, through web page input. If left unprotected, SQL injections can cause havoc with web applications by compromising security, manipulating data, hoarding system resources, retrieving sensitive data, removing databases and database objects, or taking databases offline! This session will show how SQL injections work, identify if you are being attacked, and cover various prevention techniques and their effectiveness.</p>

<h3>Coupling and Cohesion Patterns and Anti-Patterns in SQL and ETL development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Frequently I encounter SQL servers and databases in enterprises with huge interdependency issues, such as linked servers, cross-database views and stored procedures, and complicated ETL packages. In this session I will show the most grievous bad practices, what sorts of problems and constrictions they cause, and how they can be re-written to achieve much looser coupling across all data in an enterprise. Any DBA or developer that uses more than two part table or view names in their queries or stored procedures should attend!</p>

<h3>Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.</p>

<h3>T-SQL : Bad Habits  Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Bad habits: we all have them. SELECT * is the obvious one; but in this session you will learn about various other habits and why they can be bad for performance or maintainability. You will also learn about best practices that will help you avoid falling into some of these bad habits. Come learn how these habits develop, what kind of problems they can lead to, and how you can avoid them - leading to more efficient code, a more productive work environment, and - in a lot of cases – both.</p>
