<h3>Reporting Services Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoft’s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - New Features included in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access. ** This session is SQLSaturday favorite and is always packed full. Don't miss it **</p>

<h3>You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query.  If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.</p>

<h3>Rapidly Deploying SQL Server with PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As much as you love SQL Server, do you cringe anytime you hear that you’ll need to stand up yet another SQL Server instance? Sure it’s fun, but who has the time? Maybe you’ve thought there must be a better way of doing this?  Sure, you have the ability to generate an unattended install file, but what about all the other things that will need to be done?  In this talk, we will explore a process that was created to truly automate not just the SQL Server install, but all of the configurations and the deployment of your organizations standard objects, all using a set of PowerShell scripts that you can download and use today. This session will review the process that has saved hundreds of hours for one organization and can do the same for yours.</p>

<h3>Revenge: The SQL!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you been wronged, cheated, lied to, lied about, or deceived by a coworker? Feel like your DBA position offers no opportunity for revenge? WRONG! This session is a light-hearted exploration of some delightfully mischievous SQL design patterns that will annoy, aggravate, and antagonize anyone who has to work with them. (But they deserved it!) Learn how to: create tables with no names; columns with duplicate names; and write perfectly valid yet utterly nonsensical SQL. You may never get to use these techniques…but you'll ache for the chance!</p>

<h3>PowerPivot: BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The paradox of Business Intelligence: it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor. Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us. Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow? In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications). The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :) I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)

<h3>Page  Row Compression Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Page and Row Compression are powerful new tools. Page  Row with SQL 2008 RTM, and Page  Row with Unicode Compression with SQL 2008 R2.  We can turn it on, we can turn it off, but we want more!  What are Access Methods and how in the SQL Engine do they affect Compression?  What are the “Gotchas” of Page Compression?  How does Compression differ in the way it treats Non-Leaf  Leaf Level pages?  What additional functionality did we get in DBCC Page, DMV’s, Perfmon Counters, and Extended Events to support our usage of Compression?  How do complex query plans affect Compression?  Come find out!</p>

<h3>Data Sharding in OLTP Systems</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for modern OLTP Systems is the amount of data needed to be collected and processed. Business requirements, industry standards and regulations require systems to retain enormous amount of information. Offline data archiving is not often an option especially with the hosted solutions - customers expect old data to be available on the fly. Keeping all data in the single instance of SQL Server is the most expensive option from hardware cost and management standpoints. 

This session demonstrates several data sharding techniques that can be used to partition the data across multiple database servers focusing on the task of separating production and historical data in OLTP systems</p>

<h3>Working With XML In SQL Server </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>XML is a technology that Developers and DBAs alike share a love-hate relationship with; it's powerful and flexible yet it can be bloated and difficult to work with at the same time. Regardless, XML has found a home in many applications - including SQL Server (e.g. execution plans) - so it's important to understand how to work with it in your databases. This session will show you how to use the XML data type, perform basic operations on XML data, and how to use FOR XML to create XML from relational data. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML when you do need to use it!

<p>When I was a freshly minted DBA and trying to learn the ropes, my manager used to tell me “You should know that, that’s DBA 101”. As much as it frustrated me, he was right. There is a core set of knowledge that DBA. Correct SQL installation and configuration, how’s and whys of backups, how to make your role proactive, and many other things fall under that heading. This session is for the “freshly minted” DBA to help them find and define their own set of best practices.

<h3>Parallel Query Execution Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What exactly does it mean to parallelize a query? Why would the optimizer do this and what are the benefits and what are the drawbacks?? Is it always faster? Can it cause problems? Are there reasons we might NOT want parallelization? What can prevent it's use by the engine? These are some of the topics we will cover as we dig into this facet of the SQL Server relational engine.</p>

<h3>Becoming DAX: An Introduction ... </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language is a library of operators and constants that we can combine to craft formulas and expressions in PowerPivot Client. In this introductory session Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson will concentrate upon crafting simple DAX expressions whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. He’ll overview a simple data source structure, outline the components of simple DAX syntax, and get you started understanding basic expressions.</p>

<h3>TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. After this session, you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.</p>

<h3>SSIS Data Flow Buffer Breakdown</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will examine the different types of data flow components, execution trees, data buffers, performance metrics and logging mechanisms. In determining how the buffers are built and used, the developer will begin to understand if, how and why package performance will be impacted when new transformations or columns are added. The developer will further learn how to capture performance metrics to identifiably track these impacts. Finally, the session will take a look at the controls and effects of parallel package and parallel task execution.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.</p>
