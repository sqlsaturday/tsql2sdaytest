<h3>Cloud Stakeholders - Top 10 Cloud Jobs </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cloud computing is already a fact, which nobody doubts. Moreover, with cloud technologies, organizations can focus on their main activities. In the cloud each user has access to the highest quality services. Along with the various positive effects, vendors face a number of problems and undeveloped areas. Preparation of the stakeholders is crucial for each project. More or less the technologies are the same, but the way we use them is not the same in the cloud. Former flaws are today’s advantages, former fundamentals for developers are no longer available in the cloud. Are we ready to forget all that we know and start over again to learn and how sustainable is the new knowledge – these are the open questions that stakeholders raise today.</p>

<h3>SSIS Package Logging</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you’ve ever worked with SSIS packages there’s no doubt you’ve been in a situation where all of the sudden the package does not behave in the way you'd expect it to and you need to quickly turn around with figuring out the cause and get the package running again. For simple packages, the task might be trivial, but as we work with more and more data and build complex ETLs using SSIS, it is necessary to have a detailed outlook into your package's execution and progress.
In this lecture we will go over the different approaches and best practices for logging for SSIS packages. We will also talk about the Integration Services Catalog in SSIS 2012, specifically its capabilities for tracing package execution. Finally we will cover the built-in reports in SSMS 2012.

<h3>Data-driven Subscription using SSIS and SharePoint</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Reporting Services provides data-driven subscriptions to render reports based on information in a database table. This is a very nice feature but the down side is that you are required to purchase an Enterprise license (or BI license in SQL 2012) of SQL Server in order to use this feature. Customers like this feature but don't want to pay for the Enterprise license so I searched for an alternative with standard licenses. In this session I will show the alternative where the end user can still create his own subscription in SharePoint. Step-by-step  I will create an SQL Server Integration Services package that renders reports to a SharePoint library on values stored in the database.</p>

<h3>Stored procedures — facts and myths</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Everybody knows that use of stored procedures offers a number of benefits over issuing T-SQL code directly from an application. In this demo heavy session I am going to explain to you:
1. Why plan caching and reuse is a good thing.
2. How to avoid unnecessary recompilations for plan stability-related reasons.
3. How to avoid unnecessary recompilations for plan optimality-related reasons.
4. When plan reusing is not a good thing and how you can deal with this “Parameter Sniffing” problem.
5. Why you should evade conditional logic inside stored procedures that do data access.</p>

<h3>Data Visualisation with Hadoop Mashups, Power View and Excel 2013</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Hadoop ecosystem is a valuable tool for Business Intelligence and Data Visualisation practitioners. It allows you to mashup unstructured data from Hadoop with structured data from more traditional relational and multi-dimensional sources. For Business Intelligence practitioners, this is an excellent tool to gain new business insights, and overcome data silos that come from within the organisation, whilst freeing you to make use of external data sources too.
Join us at this session in order to see how your Big Data can empower your business users via familiar Business Intelligence tools such as Excel and Power View.</p>

<h3>Data Mining 2012 with Microsoft Excel 2013 and PowerPivot</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This presentation introduces the decision-making ability possible with the free Excel add-ins for PowerPivot and SQL Server Data Mining. The data mining is a service hosted in Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services 2012, but the Excel add-in exposes the enterprise-strength server technology to analysts and executives.

<h3>The Two Faces of SQL Parameter Sniffing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>MS SQL parameter sniffing (or "Bind Variable Peeking" in Oracle) is designed for good. 
Following some common best practices developers create procedures, analyze actual execution plan, test performance with various sets of data and it is then that they deploy. How about when the same good  procedure that used to run less than 100ms starts to timeout...in production? Then you may have become a victim of bad query plan due to parameter sniffing.
This may sound as a sci-fi scenario but is rather a real life use case which anyone may encounter. Join this session to get practical ideas of how to identify the cause, avoid typical mistakes and perform a fix.
