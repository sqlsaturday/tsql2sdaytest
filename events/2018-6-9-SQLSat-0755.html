<h3>Eyes on the Prize:  Simple and Effective Dashboard Visualization Techniques</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When done right, data visualization informs users quickly and efficiently with a minimum of distraction.  When done wrong, we end up with spinning 3D pie charts.  In this talk, we will look at techniques for effective dashboard design, minimizing noise and clutter (like spinning 3D pie charts) while providing relevant information to the intended audience.  We will see how different types of charts work, build out rules of thumb around which charts to use, and integrate visuals to create a coherent dashboard image.  When it comes to dashboards, we will compare and contrast dashboards based on their intended uses, such as interactive dashboards versus TV dashboards.  Finally, we will take an awful dashboard and turn it into something which end users will appreciate.</p>

<h3>Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure SQL Database offers a way to quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.</p>

<h3>Patterns for Managing Your Career Learning Needs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most of us want to "keep up" with changes in the technologies we use and most of us feel like we're failing to do so. Can that be right? Is it possible to learn what what we need to learn in order to stay current and still have time for a life outside of work? It is!

This presentation is about patterns you can apply to how and when you learn. My goal is to give you the ideas and techniques that will help you learn effectively and do so for your entire career - something you can use for 40 years!

Attendees - bring your lists. Bring the list of stuff of you want to learn or think you should learn. Take a few minutes to write down the challenges you've had in 'keeping up'. We'll discuss some during the session and I'll be available afterward for one on one conversations for the rest!</p>

<h3>Blockchain - A Database Architecture Paradigm Shift</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Joe takes you on an easy to understand journey of Blockchain technology. Blockchain is the basis of Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Bitcoin etc., however, extends way beyond these as a framework for Smart Contracts.

To better understand developer Blockchain opportunities, Joe deploys an Ethereum simulated multi-member network in Azure, consisting of a set of load-balanced transaction nodes with which an application or user can interact to submit transactions and a set of mining nodes to record transactions.

Joe will also investigate new toolsets coming out to assist in Blockchain Development including CoCo Framework, App Builder and Enterprise Smart Contracts.</p>

<h3>Quick and Dirty Push Datasets with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using Power BI, you can connect to hundreds of different data sources.  Once you have published your data to the Power BI service, you can use an on-premises gateway to refresh your datasets up to every 15 minutes.  Power BI can also connect live to large cubes that are a result of very complex ETL and calculations.  Some of these cubes may only be refreshed daily or weekly.  For real-time streaming of data, you can use Azure Stream Analytics or the Power BI REST API.  

Have you heard of Power BI push datasets?  With push datasets, data is pushed into the Power BI service.  Since it is stored there, you can use all of Power BI's report building features with it.

In this session, I walk through the different options for real-time streaming in Power BI.  I will demonstrate setting up a push dataset and show you a very easy way to push data to Power BI using PowerShell.  I will also demonstrate a Power BI push dataset connected to a Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision app.</p>

<h3>So You think You can Speak?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you've ever enjoyed or admired the knowledge and know-how of a speaker at a SQL Saturday or a Summit , remember that they started where you are, with an interest in SQL and I.T. topics, a passion to learn more, but also with the desire to share what they know with their peers.
If you have an interest in SQL or any of the Microsoft Data platform technologies, and have learned something useful in your I.T. career, consider giving back to the community by sharing what you know. While it may seem intimidating to give an hour long talk at an event like this, remember that every great speaker had to start somewhere. And for you, maybe that start is here! 
"Do You Think You can Speak" is a friendly competition for anyone, even first time speakers, to share for 5 - 10 minutes on a technical topic, SQL, Business Intelligence, Power BI, or otherwise, that is informative, useful, and entertaining.</p>

<h3>Data Science, and the changing Role of Data professionals; Data-Information-Knowledge and Wisdom</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Science techniques are becoming popular and because statistics usually teaches at the Math Department people think of it as an exact science but Statistic is the science of prediction and expectations. In the excitement of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we are forgetting that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model has intrinsic limitations. 
Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reached, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all have reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. 
We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom.
How is Data Science and Big Data changing our profession? What is a Data Scientist? Which skills do we need?</p>

<h3>Cautionary Tale of Recompilations, Excessive CPU Load and Plan Caching</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server reduces compilation and optimization overhead by caching and reusing execution plans for the queries. Plan caching helps to reduce CPU load on the server; however, it may also introduce unexpected issues and lead to suboptimal execution plans and performance problems.  

In this session, Dmitri will explain how plan caching works internally and demonstrate how to address several common issues related to the plan caching. He will talk about parameter sniffing, simple and forced parameterization, OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN strategy, and several other related topics.    Finally, Dmitri will provide the guidelines how to reduce CPU load and recompilation overhead in the systems with heavy ad-hoc workload and non-parameterized queries.</p>

<h3>Brand yourself like a pro 2.0 "How to tell the story"</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are many "social media outlets" but not all of them are "the right one" for you, especially if you don't have a brand. 
Building a brand has to be intentional. You cannot just be you. Discovering the things that make you unique is not enough. You have to package these things in a way that highlights and perhaps even over exaggerates them.
In this interactive session, you will learn how to use Social Media to create your personal brand to positioning yourself as a pro, telling the story in the way that the people want to hear at the same time that you increase your self-confidence.</p>

<h3>APPLY Yourself</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</p>
