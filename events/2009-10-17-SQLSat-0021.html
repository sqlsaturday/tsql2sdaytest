<h3>Taking Control of SQL Server Error Logs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server Error Logs contain vital information for the day to day DBA. For 1 to 10 servers, reviewing the error logs can be an enlightening experience done manually. For 200+ servers it is more than a chore and automating the consolidation and analysis of the error log contents is essential to be a successful DBA. From failed login attemtps to data corruption, this session will show you how to maintain error log history, raise errors in code that will write to the error log and most importantly, centralize and report on specific errors across multiple servers. The solution will use several different technologies including SSIS and the MERGE statement, new to SQL Server 2008.</p>

<h3>RESTful Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With ADO.NET Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This session will describe RESTful Data, the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.</p>
