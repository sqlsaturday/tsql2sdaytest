<h3>Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.0</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell. Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but we’re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell. This session will take you from nothing and explain what powershell is all about. I’m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, you’ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else. So in this session I’m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.</p>

<h3>Knowledge Mapping-Sharing the Wealth of Your Team's Expertise</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Picture this: Employee A left your company after working there for 5 years. Employee A was a jack of all trades. They created some processes, participated on committees, and overall had great business knowledge. Employee B gets hired, and is looking for information to be effective in their role. Unfortunately Employee A's knowledge and how to's of daily tasks went undocumented. It has become challenging to reach Employee A to inquire about these things. 

Organizational survival depends on many things, and one of the critical things it depends on is the flow and exchange of knowledge of business practices. Knowledge mapping is an activity that outlines business tasks critical to organizational life, the people responsible, required resources, outputs, and inputs. This session will inform participants about the purpose of knowledge mapping, the process, how to capture knowledge, and how to support a successful knowledge management initiative.</p>

<h3>A DBA's guide to full stack performance troubleshooting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.</p>

<h3>Developing Custom Extractors for Azure Data Lake</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Data Lake Analytics provides a set of built in extractors to process well-structured delimited text files. U-SQL uses these extractors to parse these files
But U-SQL is not limited to processing delimited files. Using Custom Extractors you can parse JSON or XML files.  You can use Custom Extractors to work with irregularly formatted delimited files.  Custom Extractors can even parse image files.
Developers have created Custom Extractors for these and other file formats and made them available on the U-SQL GitHub site.  We will look at two of these Custom Extractors:  Flexible Schema Extractor and the JSON Extractor.  We will look at how to deploy these Extractors and extend them.</p>

<h3>CQRS Lite and Otherwise</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A popular buzzword, CQRS is often misunderstood and more often misused. Less of an architecture, than a set of related techniques and an architectural flavor, it is an important and powerful technique to have in your arsenal. Here we will discuss traditional CQRS, break it down to its essence, and discuss a lightweight alternative by which an application can be created without much of the overhead and a straightforward transition path to a fully CQRS style.</p>

<h3>Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance, concurrency and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from the same flaws.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with Git/GitHub</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you manage code, you understand the struggle of choosing how you source control it. While there are many choices out there, Git has become a popular option for many development teams. While it has many strengths, understanding Git can be a struggle for developers who are not used to distributed source control. In this session, we will go over the basic concepts of Git, from building and cloning a repository to branching, forking, and code merges. We will use real world examples of how Git and GitHub can be used to manage global development teams. Attendees will leave with a solid understanding of how Git works, how to get started with their own GitHub repository, and some tools that can be used to manage their code.</p>

<h3>Well, actually...  An entertaining WIT session for the men</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>IT can be an inhospitable, isolated place for women  minorities. Women are leaving IT at 2.5x rate as men and are interrupted 3x as often. Our credentials are called into question.  We're called emotional or aggressive. We have our own job explained to us. People of color often can't get a call back on an application, regardless of how experienced they are.  Bias exists everywhere.  It's in our nature. 
 Sometimes it's subtle.  Other times it's overt. 
Most of the guys we work with are stand-up, respectable WIT allies.  There's always that one guy who ruins it for the rest of you. The problem is, you don't always notice when it happens.  Learn what those subtle forms of sexism  racism look like at work.  Learn how you can stop that guy in his tracks.  Learn how to not BE that guy, even when you're just trying to help.</p>

<h3>Learn to Love Lisp: A look into Clojure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp. It's a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multi-threaded programming. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. Though it's functional, it was designed to be practical, and features specific constructs for mutability such as software transactional memory (STM). We'll talk about the core features of Clojure, some of the fundamental ideas behind functional programming, and how to develop "live" with the REPL.</p>

<h3>Is My Application Bias Showing?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Computers can't be biased, right?  I mean, it's just lines of code.  Yes or No.  Ones  Zeros.  Those lines of code are written by people.  People have life experiences that color how they see the world.  Okay, let's be blunt.  People have baggage.  And that baggage is seeping into your application, surveys and web forms.  
You've got an idea for a new app and it's going to change the world! Right?  It's a brilliant idea  no one has ever thought of it before.   You're working on the GUI for your company's web portal and you know just what information to collect from the user.  Are you sure about that?  Odds are pretty good that the information you're going to collect is a reflection of your life  your experiences.  
Learn how to identify bias when it seeps in, how to code to be inclusive instead of exclusive , and some quick tips  tricks to make sure you're accounting for all the users that will use YOUR application to change the world.  Instead of just the ones that look like you.</p>

<h3>Fishing for Answers: Azure Data Lake</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did you ever hear someone say “make your data lake your staging area for your data warehouse” or “a data lake can handle any data format” or “if I build a data lake data everyone will use it”?  Really? Are these good ideas and true statements?  Is there a design strategy that I should follow so I don’t end up with a “data swamp”? Are there tools or techniques to load data into the lake and get data out easily? Can I easily visualize my data in the lake? What about security? And finally, how does a data lake really fit into my BI landscape when I have so many infrastructure and tool options to pick from?
This session will demo putting data into a data lake, pulling data, visualizing data, and testing data lake performance.  I will evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and implementation approaches.  At the end of the session everyone should have a clear picture of what Azure Data Lake is, how to implement it, and is it a good fit for your organization.</p>

<h3>CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>After years of snake oil salesmen and good-meaning but part-time developers, Acme Oil  Gas company’s databases have become something Rube Goldberg would be proud of and they've hired you to sort everything out. What are some of the things you can expect to find and how can you fix them? From spaghetti code that references views inside of views nested in other views, to overly indexed tables that generate 10x the disk IO and contention they should, we’ll talk about database development, administration, and plenty of things in between.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB SQL API</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Developers are interested in consuming and processing very large amounts of data as quickly as possible. Azure Cosmos DB is a NoSQL document database service designed for modern mobile and web applications which require fast reads and writes of unstructured data feeds. Azure Cosmos DB natively supports JSON documents which is a key performance feature. 
In this session, you will learn how to: create a Cosmos DB instance in Azure; work with JSON documents; create Ad hoc queries with familiar SQL syntax; create application logic as stored procedures, triggers and user defined functions (UDFs) using standard JavaScript; manage security; modify indexes; stream twitter data into a collection; extract data using SSIS C# script tasks into SQL Server; visualize data using PowerBI; and finally compare performance and feature differences between SQL Server 2017 and Azure Cosmos DB when working with JSON data.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Application Security</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you ever get the feeling that your Information Security department is out to make your life hard? Do you think perhaps they think the same thing about developers? (hint: They usually do.) Have you ever wondered how you could make that relationship better? Then this session is for you! 


In this introduction to application security we will go over the “basics” of security, specifically in regards to web applications. We will touch on things like what that OWASP thing is, the differences between authorization and authentication, and why most Two-Factor authentication has an off by one error. We will also look at ways to test your applications for security vulnerabilities so that the next time you hand your applications off to the security team you can have a better feeling about the results you will get back.</p>

<h3>Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server and Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/2017 and Azure SQL DB with predicate based RLS and in Power BI, as well.

This session will show how organizational  asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/2017, Azure SQL Database and Power BI without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations.

Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS.</p>
