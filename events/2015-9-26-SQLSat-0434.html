<h3>SQL Server  Power BI Geographic and Temporal Predictions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data science, predictive analytics, insights, statistics… There are so many buzzwords around these days. These words are frequently used in an introduction to some technical article, at the beginning of a presentation, and even in regular talk. However, when it comes down to a real analysis, you typically get reports with very nice Power BI graphs, but without real forecasting. It is up to you to recognize the patterns and then probably make some kind of interpolation by yourself. Data mining is the part that is based on statistics and can really make forecasts automatically. Data mining is part of SSAS installed in multidimensional mode. Is it possible to get the best from both words? This advanced session explains the forecasting algorithms and shows how you can integrate geographic and temporal predictions in Power View and Power Map visualizations and interactive animations. Popular buzzwords finally get some real meat behind them.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Azure DocumentDB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure DocumentDB is a new highly-scalable NoSQL database platform on Microsoft Azure, designed as a fully managed cloud service for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports schema-free designs, and scales across replicas with fast write performance and eventual consistency. But DocumentDB also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios, which you will learn about in this session. The platform is based on HTTP/REST, embraces JSON as a standard document format, and is supported by a wide range of SDKs for .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, and Node.js. Without defining any index paths, new documents are queryable within milliseconds, using SQL grammar or LINQ. Learn these and other capabilities, including server-side JavaScript-based stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, tunable consistency, and more.</p>

<h3>Debugging SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When you were young, did you enjoy taking things apart to look at their inner workings? If you did, or still do, this session might be just the thing for you! Combining SQL Server internals with our curiosity on how things work, we will take a look underneath the hood of SQL Server by debugging it.

In this session we will debug the various parts of SQL Server using WinDbg. I’ll show you how to setup, configure and use WinDbg to extract information from a running SQL Server process. We will take a look at the various dump files that record information when a SQL Server crash occurs, capturing valuable information on why SQL Server crashed. And finally, I will demonstrate how you can use Extended Events to create dump files when specific conditions occur, helping you learn more about why they occur.

Don't worry if you are not a programmer. We will go through this session at a relaxed pace without causing (too many) headaches!

<h3>Now Where Did THAT Estimate Come From? - Part 1</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>NB: This is part one of a two-part session
The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there?
In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are built and maintained and how they are used to estimate row counts. But you will also learn how filters and joins influence those estimates.
Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries.</p>

<h3>The dangerous beauty of Bookmark Lookups</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know Bookmark Lookups in SQL Server? You like their flexibility to retrieve data? If yes, you have to know that you are dealing with the most dangerous concept in SQL Server! Bookmark Lookups can lead to massive performance losses that blows up your CPU and I/O resources! Join me in this session to get a basic understanding of Bookmark Lookups, and how they are used by SQL Server. After laying out the foundation we will talk in more details about the various performance problems they can introduce. After attending this session you have a better understanding of Bookmark Lookup and you are finally able to tell if a specific Bookmark Lookup is a good or bad one.</p>

<h3>Desigining Complex Tabular Models - A Case Study</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>While building of Tabular Models may be straight forward it rapidly becomes more complex when you steer off-piste and into more complex design pattern such as:
- Many to Many relationships
- Semi-Additive Measures
- Last Ever Non Empty
- Events in Progress
- Versioned Fact Tables
- Almost real time processing requirements
- Huge volume
- Non Star Schema Data Warehouses
- measure explosion and lack of calculated dimensions
- Selecting Hardware

This one hour session will walk through an actual case study of a tabular model and discuss the pain points we encountered on the way, along with solutions and workarounds.

<h3>Big Data for the SQL Ninja</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As more enterprises start implementing big data solutions, how does the DBA support these efforts and do they have the skills and knowledge to integrate big data solutions into your current architecture and processes? This demo-filled session has two purposes; first, to help DBAs understand how to apply their existing SQL Server skills in understanding and utilizing HDInsight and related technologies. Big data technologies don’t need to be intimidating, and this session will help DBAs see how they can easily apply their current skill when working with big data. Second, this session will show how SQL Server and HDInsight be used together to create solutions to solve big data problems without the complexities of massive learning curves and using technologies DBAs are already familiar with. We’ll look at technologies that make working with big data much less daunting, including HiveQL and Sqoop, both of which don’t require a rocket science degree to use.</p>

<h3>Moving away from SQL Profiler to use Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will guide you with practical tips  tricks to move away from SQL Profiler and use Extended Events instead.
Extended Events were first introduced in SQL Server 2008 and should be used instead of the SQL Profiler. Still lots of DBA's and DEV's use SQL Profiler nowadays because of the convenience and lack of an Extended Events GUI in SQL 2008. 
Extended events however impose a minimal performance penalty on SQL Server and provides much more detailed tracing.</p>

<h3>Boost your analytical superpowers with spatial data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Analyzing huge sets of data isn't something humans are made for. Humans are more suitable for making decisions based on things they can see. So how do you bring that into the business? One of the options you have is to visualize some of your (location based) data on maps. A feature for this in SQL Server is called spatial data (geo data). By using physical locations and shapes to visualize data, you can quickly analyze big sets of data.

In this session, we're going to take a look at how spatial data works, how you can query it, and how to use it to leverage your decision making process.</p>

<p>I#39;m a Microsoft Business Intelligence consultant at ilionx with a focus on SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). I started my career with some ASP, ASP.Net, MCMS and SPS assignments and made the switch to BI when Microsoft released SQL Server 2005.
I try to blog at least once a month about SSIS (and related stuff) and  try to answer questions on the SSIS forum on MSDN where I#39;m a moderator. And last year I wrote an SSIS Scripting book to show you how to use C# or VB.Net within SSIS.</p>
