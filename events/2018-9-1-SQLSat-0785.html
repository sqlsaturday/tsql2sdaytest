<h3>DevOps 101 for Data People</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In 2009 John Allspaw and Paul Hammond delivered the session "10 deploys per day - Dev  ops cooperation at Flickr." In forty six minutes they changed the way millions of people would think about the software delivery process for years to come. It didn't have a name yet, but DevOps was born. DevOps folk preached about the cloud, automation, rapid delivery and any database technology that wasn't relational.
 
In 2013 Kenny Gorman declared "The DBA is Dead".
 
For the record, I don't believe that, but a lot of people do. What is certain is that the world of IT is changing and traditional roles are changing with it. We all need to adapt.
 
In this interactive talk I'll explain what DevOps is, where it came from, and its implications for SQL Server. I'll demo example solutions to some of the foundational technical challenges (source control and test/deployment automation) and will leave plenty of time at the end to answer your questions.</p>

<h3>Daily indexing problems and its - possible - solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever been in the situation that an application performed well the last day and - suddenly - you run into problems? Although you have Index Maintenance jobs and statistics up to date you will monitor a big degrade of performance! This session will demonstrate in a over 80 percent demo based presentation the following scenarios which happend this way in real life!
- Why performance degradation in spite of maintenance jobs?
- just one more database in the result set and the query runs really bad - why?
- usage of literals is completely different from the usage of variables - why?
- identical data types but the query runs in part perfect and in part bad...
- your execution plan shows an INDEX SEEK - but the table will be scanned!
- you get a query from the business which performs really bad but when you test it it runs pretty cool - why?</p>

<h3>SQL Server Reporting Services 2017 on Steroids!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.</p>

<h3>Wading into Stream Analytics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Large volumes of data originate at high velocity from various sources including IoT devices and sensors, web sites and social media feeds. A common approach is to simply store these data for offline processing.

Processing that in many instances never happens...

Wouldn't it be more efficient and effective to process the data stream as it arrives?

Azure Stream Analytics is an event-processing engine which enables processing of streaming data in real time. It can handle up to 1 Gb of data per second, which should suffice for most applications.

In this tutorial I'll take you through the processing of setting up a job on Azure Stream Analytics. I'll look specifically at the following:

- connecting to a data source
- extracting information
- identifying patterns and relationships
- using machine learning
- triggering actions
- reporting tools and
- offline processing.

To illustrate these concepts we'll build a real time sentiment analysis system for streaming data from Twitter.</p>

<h3>Power BI Report Design for the aesthetically challenged</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you ever worry that your reports look they were born in the 90s, or designed by a grade 1? Do you feel overwhelmed when tasked with creating attractive reports which tell the customer a story?

Thankfully, a few simple design concepts can have big impacts on your reports. There are easy-to-learn techniques and patterns to create a pleasing look and feel to our reports, and some well defined principles to decide which visual is most appropriate in your situation.

Join me in this session to learn:

- How to choose the right visual to complement the data message.
- Best practices for visual formatting to tell a complete story.
- Colour theory - designing a colour palette, and ensuring accessibility.
- Layout techniques for clean and simple reports.
- Real estate management, or how to fit everything on a report without it looking cluttered and losing effectiveness.</p>

<h3>Re-engineering legacy SQL Server Radius Accounting processor archiving solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In an outdated "resource hogged" solution the data archiving strategy of using stored procedures for DML with no caching, validation, exception handling and working automation was preventing thousands of the organisations client internet usage data from being correctly reported, due to lost records causing data integrity issues. This was a huge concern for the organisation as it affected the service ratings and client retention. In this presentation we relive the empirical process by going through the solution demonstrating the SSIS Incremental Data Loads method, discussing the creation and purpose of read and write tables, implementing indexes whilst keeping fill-factor, rebuilds and reorganization in mind, as well as provisioning staging tables for troubleshooting and verification purposes. Lastly we end off with the mirrored architecture's scheduled SQL agent jobs automation and notifications.</p>

<h3>Demystifying Azure Information Protection</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Lets face it. Excel is still the largest used BI tool in the world. From traditional end user all the way up to organisational BI, data is still sucked into Excel and shared across the business. Now we know that at a data level, data is encrypted at REST and in transit but what happens once the data is surfaced in traditional applications like Excel? How do we ensure that the output (The excel file) is secured, protected and retained? Enter Azure Information Protection.

In this session we unpack:
·         What is Azure IP
·         How to find content that needs protection
·         How to use Azure IP to protect your content
·         How to build out you Information protection strategy

In the mobile first, work from anywhere world we live it, managing access control is only half the journey to ensuring that your content is protected from misuse and inadvertent dissemination.</p>

I believe that people are the core building blocks of every business but that doesn’t mean that we can treat every ‘block’ the same. I have over 13 years’ experience in the Recruitment Industry and I have specialised in the IT Applications space for most of this time. I have recently decided to flex my entrepreneurial muscle and I have launched my own Sourcing Training Business. I am passionate about raising the standard of Sourcing in Africa.</p>
