<h3>GITHUB 101 - An introduction to using Github and Git for Source Control and Open Source Projects</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the last few years the requirement to understand and use distributed Source control systems has become an increasing part of a Data Professionals life. 
With the move into Open Source and community involvement even Microsoft has embraced the use of GitHub!

In this session we will investigate the setup and use of GitHub and Git for source control.
Using the highly popular DBATools open source project we will also investigate getting involved in an Open Source project and the process of Pull and Push requests!

Based around personal experience of learning not to hate Source control, this session assume no experience with Git or Github</p>

<h3>Graph Databases with Azure Cosmos DB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Graph Database technology is one of the fastest growing fields of database design and evelopment.

In SQL Server 2017 a new option to process Graph Data within the database engine was  added.
This was based around the Cypher Query language from Neo4J

At the same time a Graph Data API was added to Azure Cosmos DB (Microsoft's Globally Distributed Mult-Model cloud databse)
This was built around the Apache TinkerPop graph traversal language, Gremlin

In this Session we will briefly look at use cases for Graph Database and then investigate how these have been implemented in Azure Cosmos DB.

This session is aimed at any developer/architect/DBA that is looking to understand Graph Database and how they have been implemented inside Microsoft's new Cloud based  NoSQL database.</p>

<h3>DevOPs and the Data Professional</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.

In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at how both BI, DEV and DBA Professionals can benefit from it.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Due to their complexity database changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise DevOps.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to running databases hosted in Azure the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement DevOps processes in their database and BI deployment pipeline.</p>

<h3>Trend Analysis of SQL Server Logs using Powershell!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DBAs regularly need to keep an eye on the error logs of all their SQL Servers.When server numbers get large, it becomes very difficult to manage them. If you don't maintaining the error logs, SQL Server will recycle the log and you are going to loose the valuable information. In this session, you will learn how to automatically parse the errors from multiple SQL error logs using PowerShell, store the data in a central location database, and create reports to visualize the information using PowerBI or Splunk.</p>

<h3>Real-time Data Analytics using Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics and Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Stream Analytics is all about fast moving real-time data analytics where you can analyze the data near real-time in order to make actions before it is too late to do so. Ex: You may need to identify fraudulent credit card transaction in real time before making the payment. Similar to that, there are numerous real-world scenarios which we can apply Stream Analytics in order to solve problems more effectively and efficiently. Let's see how to perform Stream Analytics using Microsoft technologies like Azure Stream Analytics and Power BI</p>
