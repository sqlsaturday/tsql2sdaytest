<h3>You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query. If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.</p>

<h3>Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you remember what it was like to fall in love? Wasn't it wonderful? 

Lately it hasn't been the same. There's no spark anymore. You've been stuck doing the same old charts and tables. Maybe Reporting Services won't tell you what's wrong, and you're even thinking about seeing other reporting products.

In this session, Doug will re-ignite your passion for RS by reminding you how reports perform best, what RS has been trying to tell you (but you haven't been listening), and show you some new -- and easy -- tricks you may not have known RS can do. You'll leave knowing more about troubleshooting using the execution log, understanding how to design reports for high performance, how to deal with blank pages, and more.</p>

<h3>Administering the BI Stack</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>More often than not, a SQL DBA will also be requested (or required) to administer *other* applications in the SQL universe.  These applications are often the BI stack, SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS.  In this session, you will learn not only what each of these applications does, but also some behind the scenes views into how they work.  At the end of this session, you will have a better feeling of what to look for when something goes wrong, and have the knowledge to be proactive with your Business Intelligence implementations.

This session will focus on the SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS engines in this session.  Not a session for developers, we will be focusing on the ADMINISTRATION of these applications/services only.</p>

<h3>Minimal Processing for Large Cubes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Processing large cubes can consume vast amounts of IO, and create lengthy response times. This presentation will demo how to process dimensions and dynamically create, process, and delete measure group partitions to minimize IO. By taking control of cube processing through a SSIS package you are able to process only the bare minimum in order to bring a cube current while keeping response times acceptable. Additional areas to cover will include the support tables to control cubes, and a review of the XMLA for creating, processing, and deleting.  This method is also helpful for processing many smaller cubes.</p>

<h3>Merge Replication for Offline Data Mobility</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many times have you been sitting in a meeting and you hear, “We want all our users to have access to the data, 24/7. That includes when they are offline and on a client location”. At this point you may start letting out a large sigh because you are thinking, “How could the user get to the data if there is no connection?” This isn’t as hard as you may think and this session will show how to use SQL Servers Merge Replication in order to accomplish the task. Merge replication offers a scalable option for data mobility. This session will go over how Merge Replication can be used to replicate data to users that spend many hours offline.

<h3>Upgrade Roadmap: Let’s delve into SQL Server 2012 </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We will review the upgrade process to SQL Server 2012. An upgrade is 75% project planning and 25% execution. Everyone knows that, right? Actually, no. A checklist of considerations a company would likely encounter coming from SQL Server 2005/2008 or R2. The pros and cons of in place upgrade vs. the build out new approach. There will be many real world lessons learned sprinkled in as the presenter has led many upgrades and migrations of SQL Server. Key takeaways include: when to upgrade in place compared to build new, usage of and how to gauge the usefulness of Upgrade Advisor, deprecated features and how to test for them</p>

<h3>Holy Crap! Someone Put the Database in the Cloud</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The world of databases is constantly changing.  It used to be that we kept all of our servers and data locked up in big, expensive server rooms in the back of the building.  Now days, you hear about data existing in this cloud-thing.  So what happens when you come in on Monday morning and the latest database was deployed in the cloud.  In this session, we’ll look at what it means to be a DBA with SQL Azure and how the more things change the more they stay the same.</p>

<h3>SSIS: Figuring Out Configuring</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As with most things in the IT world there is more than one way to skin the SSIS configuration cat.* I'll focus on SQL Server 2008 methods (being called Package Deployment method in SQL 2012) and show how to use 1)XML config files or 2)an environment variable or registry entry that points to a config database. I'll also give a brief overview of the new project deployment method in SQL 2012.

<h3>DBCC Commands: The Quick and the Dangerous</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are many DBCC statements at the disposal of Database Administrators and Developers. Some are used for the greater good; others can wreak havoc in your system.

<h3>A Powershell Driven Life</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Why am I here?  This is a question you might ask yourself each day at work.  Perhaps its mundane tasks, reactive troubleshooting, or just filling out TPS reports on a Friday afternoon.  This session is going to attack the mundane and show you some of the things Powershell can bring to the table for working with SQL Server.  From performance monitoring to writing tests, it promises to be entirely scripts and demos compiled from real work on a large OLTP SQL environment .  The theoretical will be ignored as well as any common decency towards mass produced beer.       

No SSIS or Powerpoint will be harmed during this presentation.  </p>

<p>Walk-up work. 
New database requests. 
Users running ad-hoc queries with 18 LEFT OUTER JOINS against heaps.
Suprise SQL instances created by vendors without our knowledge crashing around us!
It's enough to drive a lesser DBA crazy-insane.  That's why it's important to take as many steps as you can to simplify, automate, tweak, and tune the tasks you can manage so you have time to deal with those situations you can't control.
