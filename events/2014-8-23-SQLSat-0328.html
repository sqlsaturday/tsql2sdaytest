<h3>Zero to Hero with PowerShell and SQL Server in 1 Session</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in the SQL Server world. Those who are using PowerShell, and those that will be. In this session you'll learn how to become one of the "cool kids" using PowerShell.

We'll begin with a super fast paced introduction to PowerShell starting with a quick overview of the two environments you can use PowerShell in, command windows and the ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment). Next you'll learn about cmdlets, variables, functions, and logic flow. But wait, there's more! After that we'll learn how to interact with SQL Server using the SQL Provider. For the last dance we limbo, going low level with the the SQL Managment Object library, also known as SMO.

Don't be left behind, learn how to leverage the power of PowerShell in your SQL Server environment. </p>

<h3>How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.</p>

<h3>Learn PowerShell or Die! for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Learn PowerShell or Die! That is, learn PowerShell or your career in IT will die. PowerShell is one of those technologies that as a DBA you’ll either love or hate, but believe it or not DBA’s already have the mindset for scripting since you live and work with T-SQL day in and day out. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate the different methods of retrieving information from your SQL Servers to include a way to simply wrap your existing T-SQL code inside of a PowerShell one-liner, working with SQL Server in PowerShell as if it were a file system, and creating reusable tools via functions in PowerShell that use SMO to retrieve just about any information about your SQL Servers that you could imagine.</p>

<h3>What’s New in PowerShell Version 5?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With PowerShell version 4 being announced at TechEd last year and two preview versions of PowerShell version 5 already being released this year, it shows how committed Microsoft is to PowerShell and that it’s not going away any time soon which is why you can’t afford to ignore PowerShell or put off learning it any longer. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will cover the new features that are in the preview version of PowerShell version 5 to include the cmdlets in the OneGet module, the NetworkSwitch module, the PowerShellGet module and much more that you’ll have to come to this session to find out about! This session is based off of a preview version of PowerShell version 5 so everything shown is subject to change.</p>

<h3>Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.</p>

<h3>Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</p>

<h3>READY FOR PROD</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a DBA, my personal least favorite part of the development lifecycle is pushing changes to production. It means adding something unknown (no matter how well tested) to an environment that is considered stable and reliable.  Plus there are other things that myself (and I'm sure developers as well) would rather be doing.

In READY FOR PROD (caps for emphasis), we will explore how I believe pushing T-SQL script, SSRS reports, and SSIS packages to production should go, and I encourage those in the audience to participate so we can get an idea of how other environments push code as easily or painfully as possible.</p>

<h3>Women in Technology (WIT) Panel Discussion</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Why is technology a good career choice for women?  At first you may think, for the same reasons it's a good choice for a man.  If that's the case, then why are women either not entering or not staying in Technology?  Join us for a moderated discussion of all the reasons IT jobs work well for women, how to get them involved in tech and how to keep them in tech.  Attendees should expect an open, honest dialogue with a panel of women with many years experience in the Technology field.  Attendees are encouraged to ask questions, offer solutions, talk about what's worked for them and hopefully walk away with the ability to offer women support  encouragement in regards to a successful career in IT.</p>

<h3>The Elephant in the Room; A DBA's Guide to Hadoop </h3>

<h3>Performance Tuning for Mere Mortals Part I</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this first part of a two part series, we look at performance tuning from the very beginning.  You're a new DBA, you want to be a DBA, or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings. Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  The application is running slowly. Can you help them? Do you even know where to begin to help them?  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow."</p>

<h3>SQL Server Optimization for SharePoint</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DBAs know that SharePoint just doesn't play nice with SQL Server. SharePoint administrators know that DBAs just don't understand SharePoint. This session will show hands-on how to get a SQL Server instance set up more effectively for SharePoint 2013. It's not black magic and it doesn't involve undocumented trace flags. Maybe DBAs and SharePoint admins can't get along, but at least you'll be able to cooperate after this session.</p>

<h3>How Queries Work</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you've been writing T-SQL code for a while, but have never delved into what happens after you submit your queries there is a whole world that you are missing. Taking the next step as a T-SQL developer requires understanding the basics of the SQL Server architecture and what it means to use a declarative language. Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply? In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.</p>

<h3>Fundamentals of MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cubes and Excel go together like peanut butter and jelly. However, some questions cannot be answered by browsing a cube. Multidimensional Expressions, or MDX, unlock the full potential of your multidimensional data. Learning MDX requires a clear understanding of some fundamental concepts. Change your mental model, and advance past the MDX learning curve.</p>
