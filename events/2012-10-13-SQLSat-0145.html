<h3>Why BI Projects Fail--And What You Can Do About It</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is your organization planning to build a data warehouse or BI solution? Data warehousing projects, like many large IT projects, have high failure rates. While the exact rate of failure for data warehousing projects is difficult to pin down, the causes of these failures fall into a small number of categories. It is obviously possible to successfully complete a data warehousing project and deliver value to the business. Craig Utley has seen Microsoft BI solutions in various states of completeness at over 30 companies worldwide and has seen some awesome successes and some spectacular failures. This session addresses the reasons data warehousing projects fail and how you can succeed in overcoming these obstacles.</p>

<h3>Custom SQL Server Transaction Log Shipping</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using a custom database transaction log shipping process instead of the built in SQL Server transaction log shipping component.  Custom database transaction log shipping has several advantages, including:
a)  The SQL Server instances need not have any connectivity to one another
b)   Applying of the transaction log backups can be suspended for weeks and then enabled, with the log shipped database being brought as
          current as the most recent transaction log backup.
      While transaction log backups are suspended, the Log Shipped Database can be placed in standby/Read Only mode, for querying.
c)  Using custom database transaction log shipping also allows more control over each part of the process.

<h3>Adventures in Project Management</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Projects that run long, run over budget, or flat out fail always get management's attention, and not good attention.  This session will cover the project management process and demonstrate how it can help deliver higher quality results on time and on budget.  

Case studies and real world examples will arm managers and team leads with tools including communication management plans, requirements documentation, stakeholder management plans, and change management.  These tools will help mitigate and manage common project pitfalls like status update meetings, gold plating, and scope creep.

At the end of the session attendees will be armed with the knowledge necessary to streamline projects and how to deliver a top quality work product.

<h3>Taking the Scary out of Monster Reports</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So the big wigs have come up with a “master” report that shows everything you could ever want on a single report.  It includes grids and charts of varying sizes and complexities.  Did I mention they want it pretty as well?  In this session we will discuss how to use SQL Reporting Services  to bring it all together while avoiding the pit falls and mistakes.  The demonstration will show how to build a multi-page, dashboard style report to manage your report server showing a multitude of grids and charts.  We will discuss the challenges with data reuse and formatting while exploring techniques for getting them to work.  To get the most out of this session, you should be able to build a report in SSRS.

<h3>Bulletproof: Hardening your SQL Server from Attack</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Recent major security breaches have not only exposed customer data, but also the system vulnerabilities DBAs must overcome daily. As data protection is a DBA’s primary responsibility, establishing an impenetrable environment to host the data is the first step towards risk-free security. How can DBAs ensure SQL Servers are fortified against the latest threats and vulnerabilities? In this session, we will go through the process of hardening your SQL Server from attack from Windows Server to the database level step-by-step. I will share will share with you how establish security baselines and monitor for changes to your security foundation.

<h3>Parameter sniffing - make it work for you !</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Parameter Sniffing is usually thought of as the bad guy, in association with a performance problem in your database. Contrary to the popular belief, Parameter Sniffing is usually the good guy, continuously working under the hood to help your database applications run faster. However, it can sometimes go wrong, causing severe performance degradation of your queries. 
In this session we will discuss the workings of Parameter Sniffing and demonstrate how it helps improve the performance of your database applications. We will also explore how Parameter Sniffing can go wrong and its impact. Several ways to fix bad Parameter Sniffing will be demonstrated to help make an appropriate choice for your scenario.

<h3>The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yield interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!</p>

<h3>Bridging the Chasm: BI Theory vs. Practice</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we will gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.</p>

<h3>Hardware 301: Diving Deeper into Database Hardware</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Making the right hardware selection decisions is extremely important for database scalability. Having properly sized and configured hardware can both increase application performance and reduce capital expenses dramatically. Unfortunately, there are so many different choices and options available when it comes to selecting hardware and storage subsystems, it is very easy to make bad choices based on outmoded conventional wisdom. This session will give you a framework for how to pick the right hardware and storage subsystem for your workload type. You will learn how to evaluate and compare key hardware components, such as processors, chipsets, and memory.</p>
