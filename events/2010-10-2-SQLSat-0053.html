<h3>Essentials of a Business Intelligence Architecture</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server allows you to construct an analytic organization by creating a bona fide Business Intelligence foundation, giving you more insight into the status of the business, powerful ad-hoc reporting capabilities, dynamic analytical capabilities, and forecasts that make your psychic jealous. It's an understatement to say this requires really good data and terrific data structures. In this session, Carlos Bossy will discuss how to use SSIS to implement integration, metadata and transformations, SSAS for ad-hoc and predictive analytics, and SSRS to provide users the ability to develop their own reports. You will leave this session with a firm grasp to building a robust data architecture that achieves successful Business Intelligence.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Security - All Things Considered</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Join me for a discussion of security risks in SQL Server and the tools and processes we have to mitigate those risks.   The relationship of security to authentication, encryption, SQL Injection, SQL Browser, backups, auditing, compliance, data access layers, and more will be covered in brief.   Attendees will leave this session knowing the pros and cons of different logon methods,  and hopefully new techniques to reduce the attack surface of the SQL Servers they manage.

<h3>Going Spatial!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Spatial data is being pushed more and more into the forefront of our application universe. With the advent of MapPoint and Google Maps companies are consistently pushing the boundaries of what traditional databases can do. Now with SQL Server 2008 we have built in spatial data types that will make your life a little easier in the days to come. This session will focus on utilizing these native types to store, analyze, and retrieve spatial data as well as tools such as SSRS's integrating geospatial mapping to make you the company geospatial hero. Geospatial awesomeness fro everyone!</p>

<h3>Start Using MDX with SSAS 2008</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>MDX is difficult to learn for many reasons. One reasons is that most training starts with SELECT queries without adequately developing a fundamental understanding of the coordinate system being used. Learners are left to fill in the blank in a way that is not comprehensive, consistant or comfortable. This presentation will give beginners (and those beyond) a more comfortable grasp of how to write queries.</p>
