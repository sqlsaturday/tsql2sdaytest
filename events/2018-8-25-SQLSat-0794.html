<h3>Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree (from a user perspective)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server® has many performance WOMs (Word of Mouth), especially concerning indexes to include:
•	keep clustered index width small
•	unique indexes perform better 
•	keep non-clustered index width small
•	compressed indexes have fewer logical reads
This session dives down and looks at important items within index pages of clustered, non-clustered, and unique non-clustered indexes using the DBCC Page command to factually document index WOMs.  The effect of row data compression on clustered and non-clustered indexes are also investigated.  The demos will ascertain how the SQL Server® optimizer might use them and strive to gain some insight from a performance advantage.
The session is 80% demos. This presentation will propel the layman to a new level of index understanding.
Performance! That’s what we are all looking for. Blast off with this presentation.</p>

<h3>A Rocket Scientist Perspective on Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance!  Performance!  Performance!  That’s what the rocket scientist and SQL Developer are looking for.  Indexes can offer significant performance benefits, but can also be a detriment to overall database performance.  This session will focus on a deep dive into clustered indexes (including B-tree traversal), Primary Keys, and non-clustered indexes, their syntax and utilization, and their effect on performance in transaction and data warehouse databases.  Covering non-clustered indexes will also be examined in detail with emphasis on when and when not to use.  Included will be many live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using statistics and query plans.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Encryption</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? What about encrypting your backups? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. TDE allows you to have your database encrypted on disk and the same Encryption Hierarchy allows you to back up your database and have it encrypt the contents in the backup file.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy which is used for encryption in SQL Server and take you through keeping your secrets safe. We will also go over how Always Encrypted works as well. Master the concepts of SQL Server Encryption when you are done with this session.</p>

<h3>Deep Dive into the SSIS Catalog</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SSIS catalog is one of the best-evolved features in the SQL Server Integration Services ecosystem. With integrated package storage, Windows ACL-like security settings, built-in logging, and many other features, the SSIS catalog has become an anchor for many ETL architectures. With all this complexity, it is important to understand the inner workings of the SSIS catalog to keep it running smoothly.

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will dive into the details of the SSIS catalog. We will start with a quick survey of catalog features, followed by an exploration of the moving parts (tables, views, and stored procedures) in the catalog database. We will also review the security capabilities in the catalog, and will discuss maintenance operations. Finally, we'll walk through the mechanics of deployment and execution, reviewing what happens under the covers during these operations.</p>

<h3>Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.</p>

<h3>Are There Time Bombs in your SSIS Packages?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Could your seemingly-normal SSIS package be hiding a disaster, waiting to detonate at the most inconvenient time? Integration Services is an incredibly flexible product, and that flexibility can lead to good - and occasionally bad - design patterns. Small and seemingly trivial design decisions can lead to big issues down the road, including leaky data flows, data quality issues, paralyzing performance issues, and other explosive behaviors.

In this session, we will explore some of the most common SSIS design patterns that are potentially more harmful than they first appear. From package configuration to control flow constraints, and data flow transformations to logging, we'll demonstrate what can go wrong and show some alternative designs to prevent these types of problems from developing into bigger issues.</p>

<h3>LUNCH: Introduction to Visual Analytics and Tableau-By Kent Sloan</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A perfectly tuned database only becomes valuable when the data becomes usable to the end consumer. Giant cross tabs might have all the data but often don’t allow users to understand what is happening. This talk will help you better understand the gap between end users and your database. Visual Analytics takes into account the reality of how the human mind processes information to enable users to quickly get the answers they need. We will cover some principles of visual perception and how these perceptions can influence worksheet and dashboard design. Tableau a leading visual analytics tool will be demoed and used to provide examples.</p>
