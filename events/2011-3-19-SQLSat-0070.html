<h3>Reporting Services Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoft’s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - New Features included in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access.

** This session is SQLSaturday favorite and is always packed full. Don't miss it **</p>

<h3>Report Calcs - SSRS Source Query vs. Expressions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a report developer, you want to ensure your reports are structured for accuracy, performance, maintenance, and reusability.  One of your many decisions includes where to perform report-specific calculations when the source is a SQL Server relational database. 

In this session we will compare and contrast a sampling of functions available in T-SQL and SSRS, with an emphasis on handling aggregation, ranking, dates, and strings.   A "cheat sheet" will be available online for future reference.

Session Goal:   Identify common situations when performing calculations within SSRS is preferred, versus when the T-SQL source query may be more appropriate.</p>

<h3>T-SQL Awesomeness – 3 Ways to Write Cool SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There’s nothing quite as satisfying as writing a cool bit of T-SQL.  Luckily for us, there are some truly awesome ways to make your data do just what you need it to do, while improving performance and/or readability.  Come learn three new-school ways to expand your T-SQL repertoire with:  
•	Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE)
•	EXCEPT and INTERSECT
•	CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY
We will look at data models and scenarios you might encounter that lend themselves to these techniques, see old-school ways to solve T-SQL challenges, and then compare them to newer, leaner ways to get the same result set.  Impress your friends and confound your frenemies with your mad T-SQL skills.

<h3>Deploying Visual Studio 2010 Database Projects</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Declarative database development has made great strides forward with the Visual Studio 2010 data tools allowing developers to focus on the model instead of the implementation.  But once you have the model, what are the options for deployment and what if your solution doesn’t match the Books Online example?  The session will demonstrate multiple ways to deploy database projects using TFS Build, MSBuild, VSDBCMD, Powershell and more.  For each deployment method, automation and customization techniques will be examined and demonstrated (including the common requirement of deploying one model to multiple targets.)  Attendees will leave with a better understanding of database deployment options when using Visual Studio 2010   </p>

<h3>DW-ETL: 10 Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With data being the focal point of a data warehouse, its data integration component becomes a critical point of failure of the whole system, and to make matters worse, we, as developers, face increasingly complex scenarios and requirements such as larger number of systems and volumes of data, data quality problems and complex business logic.
 
In this session Rafael will share a compilation of pitfalls and mistakes he has seen –and made!– across many implementations, and offers recommendations to avoid them. We will look at problems related to metadata, data quality, monitoring, system reliability and some SSIS specific issues among other common problems. </p>

<h3>SSRS Administration - Enter a BIDS Free Zone</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You are about to enter the BIDS Free Zone. Beware! This session is NOT about report design, spatial data, R2 new features or .NET extensions. We will explore what the ReportServer and ReportServerTempDB databases contain. By understanding their purpose we can discuss, for your company, what recovery mode each should be in and select backup strategies. Furthermore, we will talk about two other resources to backup: the ever critical encryption key and XML configuration files. Next, we'll cover the three scalability options: caching, snapshots and scaling out. There are numerous server configurations that are familiar to administrators just hard to find. Some are so hidden you might not know they exist!</p>

<h3>Information: Are You Blinded by the Light ?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will provide you with some surprising and interesting insights into how dashboards should be designed. Called Information Visualization, there is a whole line of thinking which maps how the brain interprets what the eyes see. We will translate this into best (and worst) practices related to visualization in dashboard, scorecard, table, and report design. Both funny and informative, you will probably learn, as I did, that you have been designing your dashboards/scorecards and reports badly. We are going to take a visualization test, and learn how to convey information in a clearer, better way. You will be surprised. Join me - this session is going to be hoot!

<h3>Design and Implement BI Like Edison! </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.</p>

<h3>Bad SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.</p>

<h3>DAX Formulas: Evaluation Context</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is an expression language used to develop calculations based on PowerPivot data. A lot of its capabilities are very intuitive to Excel power users as it emulates current functionality but over a much larger set of data.  However, Its real power emerges with the ability to create aggregations that are evaluated at different contexts on the data stored in-memory. This session will explore DAX formula context, which is of great benefit when developing business calculations like ratios or weighted averages.  A brief comparison with MDX will be established in order to contrast the process followed by each language when establishing the context of a calculation.</p>

Who is responsible to ensure your database is available 24 x 7?  Is it the DBA?  Is it the server team?  Maybe it is the virtualization team?  Maybe it is a joint decision among all of those teams.  Regardless of who is ultimately responsible, this session will give you a great understanding of the options available and what they do and do not protect against to ensure the availability of your database.</p>
