<h3>Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.</p>

<h3>Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</p>

<h3>Data center migrations  – a focus on the ‘Data’</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data center migrations are all the rage these days and the SQL Server DBA is one of the most important accessories to success. I find that approximately 10-20% of all Windows Servers in the business enterprise are SQL Servers.  When an organization makes the decision to move from one data center to another, of all the very important servers that will be migrated, the ones with the company data will be the most watched. Just like any other project, a good plan followed by good execution is required. In this session you’ll learn about the research, design, planning, process, and execution that go into migrating SQL Servers from one data center to another. I’ll go over some lessons learned and discuss whether you go it alone or brings in some help.  I’ll discuss the big options and decisions on migration techniques and methodologies and the pros and cons.  You’ll also hear about the big decisions like keeping the same server names, production downtime, data synchronization  more.</p>

<h3>Administering  Managing the Power BI Environment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI for Office 365 is Microsoft's new self-service BI offering. Just because it emphasizes self-service doesn't mean a system administrator isn't an important role! In this session we will discuss the overall system components and how a Power BI site in SharePoint Online differs from an on-premises SharePoint BI site.  We will walk through how to best handle setting up connectivity to data sources, when a gateway is needed, and what data refresh capabilities exist. We will also consider how and when to create OData feeds from your corporate on-premises data sources, and how those OData feeds affect Enterprise Data Search functionality.</p>

<h3>"I Know What You Did Last Query" --SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Starting with the 2005 release, SQL Server captures information about the workload on an instance, which you can use to monitor the system, gather performance metrics, and validate system settings.  This information is available via Dynamic Management View and functions and officially they "return internal, implementation-specific state data." This session gives an introduction to these concepts, how they make DBA life much sweeter and we discuss many of the different community queries available to help you get jump started in your environment.  We also open up the floor for ideas of how you are using these views/functions.</p>

<h3>SQL Window functions in SQL Server 2008 and later</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>"Just what the heck is a window function and why should I care?"  Have you ever needed to provide a running subtotal or average in your dataset?  Need to provide a total by customer or a grand total on each row?  Need to assign row numbers or counts that change when a certain value in your data changes!  Window functions to the rescue!  That's why you should care.</p>
