<h3>Cloud Ready: Preparing Yourself for Azure SQL Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cloud computing is one of the hot topic issues of the day and Microsoft is pushing hard to show that they are in the game to win. As such, SQL Azure is your data storage in the cloud solution. However, the platform is much different from simply a SQL Server that sits in the cloud and needs to be approached in an intelligent manner. In this fast paced session, we will be going well beyond the simple “hello world” scenario to show you how to leverage the cloud architecture for data storage as well as educate you in how the cloud works differently than your local database instance. Learn all of the functionality as well as the limitations so that you can make and educated decision when looking to move resource to a cloud based environment. This session is going to be an eye opener for sure and will have many of you dreaming of your data sitting in the cloud.</p>

<h3>Demystifying BISM and Tabular Mode SSAS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SQL 2012, Analysis Services (SSAS) has seen some major changes.  An entire new method of modelling analytic data has emerged and it's called Tabular Mode Analysis Services.  In addition to that, a new semantic layer has been added to the tool, the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM), which will help to bring the two modes -- Multidimensional and Tabular -- into one level playing arena.

In this session, attendees will gain understanding of what Multidimensional and Tabular modelling IS, as well as how the BISM layer helps to translate user requests to ensure no confusion is made. Attendees will also learn how to BUILD a Tabular model, and will help design a solution live during the presentation. </p>

<h3>Why are we Waiting..</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>An in-depth session examining "Waits" happening in your SQL Servers, using the well-known "Waits  Queues" methodology. 

With particular focus in the session on understanding and interpreting the information found the (DMV) sys.dm_os_wait_stats, 
Taking note of which “Waits “with the highest counts or excessive wait times, as well as those which “Waits” can be safely ignored, 
We can discover those "performance hurdles" and ways to overcome or remove them, restoring your SQL Servers performance levels. 
By using established methodologies like “Waits  Queues”, we can systematically identify and remove performance

<h3>Anatomy of a Join</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A lot of database professionals today  do not have a Computer-Science Degree  so they never attended a  “Introduction to Databases” course. In this session we are trying to fix at least one thing and we’ll look in depth at the three types of join operations, visualize how their algorithms work in order to understand how query plans are computed, explain why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific  join operator to use in a query plan. Will demonstrate that empirical cost calculations are similar to what Query Optimizer actually outputs. Good understanding of join algorithms is vital in order to diagnose and remedy issues related to bad query plans.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.</p>

<h3>Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</p>

<h3>SSIS Templates Can Make Your Life Easier</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many times have you started a new SSIS project and added the same components that you’ve added to almost every other package you’ve created?  Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.</p>

<h3>Visualizing Your Indexes - Science vs Art</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Indexes make queries run faster, right? Not always, no. And finding the right indexes for your needs is often more of an Art than a Science. Attend this session as we take a visual tour of how indexes are laid out and the way data is accessed when indexes are utilized. We will discuss clustered indexes as well as non-clustered indexes and also when to use indexed views along with some other variations.</p>

<h3>Into a Swan - Discovering the Beauty of RESTORE</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many DBAs believe that a backup is the most important process to implement. For most, they soon realize that the most important process to the business is actually the restore. In this session, we’ll start by exploring some of the options in the SSMS restore wizard, but will quickly move to T-SQL to discover the power and beauty that writing the RESTORE statement can provide. In addition to the classic RESTORE DATABASE and LOG statements, we’ll work through some real world examples of how to leverage some of the lesser known syntax of the restore statement to help in both foreign and well known environments.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting SQL IO issues with Xperf</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Xperf is a light weight performance tracing tool based on Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).   The tool can help troubleshoot notoriously difficult SQL Server issues such as determining the root cause of slow IO's and high privileged time on the sql server process.   Xperf can help bridge the gap between SQL tracing and kernel tracing to give insight into these types of issues that previously was unavailable.  We will look at how Xperf works and how to configure it for different issues.   We'll then step through using Xperf to determine the root cause of a 15 second IO error.</p>

<h3>“Indexing” Encrypted Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.</p>
