<h3>BI for Everyone: Why, What and How of Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business Intelligence has been around for a long time, however a lot of BI projects have failed than have succeeded*. Despite knowing its shortcomings, only as of recent, have we had the right tools to make BI succeed. This session will focus on a very short history on how BI came into being and reasons for most failures. We will then look at the new wave of BI concepts and tools, and how it could help build better business intelligence solutions, and why Power BI is a tool of choice out of these. We will finally take a look at how the two main focus groups, business users and technical folk, can make use of Power BI, the part they have to play, and what they need to know, and how together they could build better business intelligence for everyone.</p>

<h3>How to Use Parameters Like a Pro and Boost Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Parameters are a fundamental part of T-SQL programming, whether they are used in stored procedures, in dynamic statements or in ad-hoc queries. Although widely used, most people aren't aware of the crucial influence they have on query performance. In fact, wrong use of parameters is one of the common reasons for poor application performance.
In this session we will learn about plan caching and how the query optimizer handles parameters. We will talk about the pros and cons of parameter sniffing as well as about simple vs. forced parameterization. But most important – we will learn how to identify performance problems caused by poor parameter handling, and we will also learn many techniques for solving these problems and boosting your application performance.</p>

<h3>PowerBI : Data Visualization SQL Saturday with R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is mainly use to learn more about Power BI and R visualization chart. From this session one can learn how can we make some simple and quick visualization using Power BI desktop taking real SQL Saturday data and publish in PowerBI cloud service and also publish those visualization reports to publicly in web. Also, this session mainly helps to tell the story of SQL Saturday by using Power BI and R visualization chart. 

Overall, by using Power BI Visualization how one can find out which SQL Saturday is conducted in which state or country in which year and a particular Day along with total sessions conducted. Also one can find SQL Saturday trends year on year and mostly in which month most of SQL Saturday is conducted as per SQL Saturday data history.
