<h3>Secure SQL Server Database Design: Tactics and Technology</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When we design and build an application, do we think about security first or is it an afterthought? As we read about more and more data breaches, it is clear that we need to think security-first when designing and building our applications.

Where does design start for an application? It starts with the database layer. In this talk, we will discuss strategies for designing a more secure SQL Server database. We will start with simple design decisions for tables, views, stored procedures, and database roles that can improve security before moving on to talk about built-in SQL Server security technologies such as Always Encrypted, Row-Level Security, Dynamic Data Masking, Transparent Data Encryption, and SQL Server Audit. Lastly, we will finish up with some tips on how to retrofit security features onto existing databases and look at how data access from the application may need to change.</p>

<h3>Inside SQL Server on Kubernetes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Containers are the new "virtual machines" and one of the hottest technologies in the industry. While containers compliment virtual machines and provide consistency, portability, performance, and availability, how do you deploy containers at scale? For many, Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, is the answer. 

In this session, we will dive deep into the Kubernetes platform and how SQL Server containers can be deployed, managed, and configured. You will see how SQL Server can take advantage of Kubernetes for "built-in" high availability, easy to deploy patching, and integration with Always On Availability groups. We will discuss deploying SQL Server in various popular Kubernetes distributions including but not limited to Azure Kubernetes Service, OpenShift, and kubeadm. This session assumes a fundamental knowledge of both SQL Server and containers. We will move fast, and go deep using demos as a method to lea</p>

<h3>Building your own million dollar SQL Practice</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Would you like to get to $1m annual revenue in 5 easy steps?
Or, do you simply want to go from barely sustainable to profitable?

In this session I will touch on the 5 steps I considered when building and growing out a SQL Data Platform practice. 
1. Choose a specialty.
- How to decide what to do, and how to make it shine.
2. Pick your partners.
- Why partnering is essential.
- Augmenting your capabilities.
3. Defining services.
- What are the differences between Managed Service and Professional Service.
- How many services to offer.
- How to pick a service and price point.
- How long before you actually make money.
4. Market your offerings.
- Yes, you have to sell, yourself.
- When to give things away for free
- The value of existing customers
5. Build your team.
- You're making it, now you need to manage it
- Bringing on the right people.

I'll also touch on how long it took me to achieve each of these, and how I measure success.</p>

<h3>Data Lake Design Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data lakes have been around for several years and there is still much hype and hyperbole surrounding their use. This session covers the basic design patterns and architectural principles to make sure you are using the data lake and underlying technologies effectively. We will cover things like best practices for data ingestion and recommendations on file formats as well as designing effective zones and folder hierarchies to prevent the dreaded data swamp. We’ll also discuss how to consume and process data from a data lake. And we will cover the often overlooked areas of governance and security best practices. This session goes beyond corny puns and broken metaphors and provides real-world guidance from dozens of successful implementations in Azure.</p>

<h3>Data Lakes with Azure Databricks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The world of analytics and data warehousing has evolved rapidly in the last 10 years with the Data Lake as the backbone of modern data environments. Data Lakes are best built leveraging unique services of the cloud provider to reduce operations complexity. This session will explain why everyone's talking about data lakes, break down the best services in Azure to build a Data Lake, and walk through code for querying and loading with Azure Databricks.

Attendees will leave the session with a firm grasp of why we build data lakes and how Azure Databricks fits in for ETL and querying.

Agenda:
	- Why Data Lakes?
	- Data Lake best practices
	- Reference Architecture implemented with:
		○ Azure Databricks
		○ Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen 2)
		○ Event Hubs for Apache Kafka</p>

<h3>Loading SQL Server Data with Powershell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Powershell has become the defacto standard for scripting Microsoft products. However, putting data in text files doesn’t scale. Here I’m going to show you the ins and outs of loading data into SQL Server using Powershell for the purpose of centralizing collections. We’re going to cover RBAR as well as bulk operations and the types of things you need to take into consideration in an enterprise setting. This is a no holds barred session taught by an enterprise SQL Server scripting expert. You can’t afford to miss this session if you do any level of scripting in your shop.

Prerequisites: Basic understanding of Powershell syntax.</p>

<h3>DevOps for Azure SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>"But... it worked on my computer!" A good DevOps practice and implementation will help eliminate that unwelcome phrase! Come to this session to learn how to use tools and platforms like Visual Studio Code, Git, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions for a modern, secure and easy-to-use database DevOps experience for Azure SQL. We will use demos to show and evaluate two approaches: first, a code-centric migration-based approach (using DbUp and GitHub Actions), and second, a more complex project/state-based approach (using Visual Studio SQL Projects and Azure DevOps and a locked-down Azure SQL DB) to understand some of the many possibilities for implementing DevOps for Azure SQL.</p>

<h3>Synapse Analytics: Beyond the Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Synapse Analytics, which is way beyond the former Azure SQL Data Warehouse, is focused on MPP, Multi Parallel Processing, being a very powerful environment for Data Warehouse processing.

It's former name, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, usually pushed many DW and BI developers to use this powerful tool in order to build a Data Warehouse. However, just implementing the logical design of a Data Warehouse inside an MPP environment can be very deceiving, because many default settings for the MPP environment will not be at their best.

On this session you will see how to configure the MPP environment to achieve it's best performance for your Data Warehouse. You will understand the importance to understand and control the distributions by compute nodes, how critical are the correct choice of resource classes and users,  the benefits to correct manage workload classification and much more.</p>

<h3>Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details of the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then  begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a free unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

<p>I am a technology leader with a strong focus on managing and mentoring talented teams to successful production of real business value. As a software engineer I learned the value of strong agile process methodology and disciplined enterprise architecture. I believe in services, platforms, and product-oriented delivery. As a leader, I strive to combine the technical and the personal to motivate people to do what they do best -- focus, code, and release. When that falls into place, computers also get to do what they do best -- keep running while we spend time with friends and family. My philosophy is that these two things need not be mutually unattainable!</p>
