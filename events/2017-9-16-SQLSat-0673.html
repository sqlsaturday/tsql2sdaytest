<h3>Accelerating DevOps and TDM Using Data Virtualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is the merger of app development, testing, and IT ops.  All tasks from coding to testing to operations should be automated so new features and fixes can be continuously quickly.

Test Data Management (TDM) is the optimization of the process of software quality, ensuring that applications properly work according to their specifications.

Constraining both DevOps and TDM is database size. "Storage is cheap" is not merely a lie, but more to the point it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around from place to place, and time itself is expensive and dear.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.</p>

<h3>The Next Frontier-  Opportunities When Migrating to the Cloud with Virtualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cloud is everywhere and the database administrator is caught in the middle. How do you know where to start and what to migrate first? How do you perform consolidation planning and ensure data security? This session builds on a full demonstration, along with tips and tricks to show how the DBA can secure their environment to allow a self-service option so they no longer are the constraints to projects! The attendee will leave with a clear understanding of:
* Principles of virtualization and why it’s the answer to so many challenges we face today.
* How easy it is to secure data in the cloud using data masking features.
* The ease of connecting to the cloud and migrating environments.
* How to troubleshoot when issues arise and the tools available to diagnose issues.</p>

<h3>Proper DataType Usage=Guaranteed Better Performance and Accuracy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. 

In this demo-heavy presentation I will show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for its usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of inappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition I will cover several data type related functions, and point out caveats in their usage. I expect even advanced T-SQL developers and DBAs to walk away with a useful nugget or two.</p>

<h3>Make Power BI Your Own with the Power BI APIs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI makes accessing data from various sources and building advanced visualizations for analytics easy to do. Behind the scenes Power BI is built on standard technologies and APIs that allow it to be customized in multiple ways to fit in with your environment the way you need it to. In this session we will walk though samples and demos that show how you can extend Power BI with custom visualizations, access custom data sources, embed various Power BI elements in your applications, and be able to push your data into a Power BI report/dashboard. Each of these items take advantage of the Power BI APIs in different ways and we will discuss each and provide the code samples for you to take back and get a head start. This session will be showing code to access the Power BI REST API using C# and NodeJS along with some M for accessing and manipulating custom data sources.</p>

<h3>Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works, but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool.
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool!
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events. 
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!</p>

<h3>Stop Repeating Yourself – Automating Azure Data Movement With BimlScript</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you begun using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to copy data to and from Azure? Have you realized how fast ADF development becomes tedious and error-prone?  Azure Data Factory can make it simple to process your data, but the minimal web UI and JSON configuration files make it easy to make a mistake. Your solution might have hundreds, or thousands, of files after you create datasets and activities for each source query or file. Finished development and need to make a design change? You could be looking at hours of manual updates. But you don’t have to settle for manual ADF development.

In this session I’ll introduce you to BimlScript and the BimlExpress add-in for Visual Studio and I'll demonstrate how to use these tools to automate the creation of ADF datasets and pipelines. I’ll use real-world examples to show you how automation can decrease your development time and encourage iterative development.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2016 Always On AGs Perf, Internals,  Lessons Learned</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Always On Availability Groups (AGs) were introduced in SQL Server 2012. AGs significantly expanded our HA/DR options. However, in both SQL 2012 and SQL 2014 two limitations were extant in the code—both Network Transport and Log Redo significantly compromised performance. In SQL Server 2016, these limitations have been significantly improved.
 
Our work shows enhancements of 7x – 10x, allowing over 1/2GB/s (4Gb/s) across the wire. These improvements expand solutions options for Tier 1 OLTP and Data Warehouse workloads, Tier 1 and Tier 2 consolidation, and more. This presentation explains the improvements, characterizes the new solutions, and shows commodity servers and modern non-shared in-server flash storage showing the profound contrast between SQL Server 2014 vs. 2016. Doing so moves the performance bottleneck from the SQL Server codebase to the CPU where it belongs.
 
1.       Revealing the fantastic perf enhancements in SQL Server 2016 AGs
2.       Sharing SQL Server 2016 AGs</p>

<h3>Kerberos Delegation Made Simple</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Kerberos delegation is often needed for SQL Server Reporting Services security. Many DBAs avoid Kerberos because of the complexity and come up with workarounds that may violate security policies in their shops. They also may not understand why Kerberos delegation is even required. 
Configuring Kerberos for SSRS can be broken down into three simple steps: SPN registration, setting delegation properties, and application configuration. It’s really not so difficult, and there are a number of tools that can help you troubleshoot when things don’t go as planned.
Attend this session to learn why Kerberos is necessary and how to configure and troubleshoot it.</p>

<h3>The New Revolution in Data Science, R integrated into SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Science is an ever increasing topic in the Data Analytics space and the R language is at the center of most conversations. R is an open source statistical language that is rapidly gaining popularity due to a robust set of machine learning functionality and a never-ending set of R packages.  

The R language is run as a desktop application and was not built with performance and scale required to accommodate Big Data. Revolution Analytics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, has solved the performance and scaling issues of a desktop application by creating a more robust enterprise architecture. SQL Server 2016 brings the power of R and Revolution Analytics into the industry leading relational database. 

This session will introduce R and demonstrate the functionality and power of using R within SQL Server. 

This presentation is ideally suited for Business Intelligence professionals that are interested in understanding the new R Service that is being added to SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Agile Data Modeling with Data Vault</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Agility and Business Intelligence are two good things that often struggle to be good together. A primary cause of this struggle is the inability of traditional Data Warehouse models to respond to change in a (business) timely manner. Data Vault is an evolution of Enterprise Data Warehouse modeling that removes the barriers to Data Warehouse agility. A Data Vault warehouse eliminates re-engineering both of the data schema and ETL as the model evolves in response to changing business needs and definitions.
In this session we’ll compare modeling techniques in real world scenarios to understand how Data Vault can make your EDW more capable and agile.</p>

<h3>Analyzing I/O Subsystem Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is often I/O bound - but why? Do you feel lost when talking to your storage administrator?  Are your storage subsystems like a mysterious black box where your databases live but you can’t go visit? This session will get you up to speed with the fundamentals of storage subsystems for SQL Server. You will learn about the different types of storage that are available, and how to decide what type of storage to use for different workload types. You will also learn useful tips and techniques for configuring your storage for the best performance and reliability. We’ll cover methods to effectively measure and monitor your storage performance so that you will have valuable information and evidence available the next time you have to discuss IO performance with your storage administrator. Come to this session to learn how to analyze I/Os as well as options to reduce the bottlenecks.</p>

<h3>The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How would you like to learn about using Virtual Reality (VR) to present information? The ability to become immersed and walk around inside of a VR environment is a new and unique way to present and look at information. As data professionals we need to be open to novel displays of data and explore what VR can do that for us that we have not been able to do in the past. VR can provide a way for people to see relationships and interact among data sets which can be difficult for computers to display visually on a flat screen.

The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality is built using Epic Games video game engine called Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). With native support for VR, UE4 has been used for applications beyond just video games. With the commercial availability of affordable VR headsets, data professionals can now create visually compelling environments that were almost impossible or extremely expensive just a few years ago on both PC and mobile devices.</p>

<h3>Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.</p>

<h3>Becoming a Master by Giving it All Away</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It has been said that novices absorb knowledge like a sponge, intermediates hoard it for themselves, and masters just simply give it away.  
The community spirit of PASS is for like-minded professionals to interact and share knowledge.  But how do you do this in your own workplace?  What happens when Bob takes off with one day of notice?  How do you manage when Jane unfortunately has to spend a month in the hospital?
All joking aside, the only way to truly become a master at your craft is to share your precious knowledge with your peers and workmates.  We will discuss past and current trends in knowledge transfer, the reasons why you should (and shouldn’t) pass on knowledge, and methods for making this happen in your workplace and in your life.
Be prepared for an interactive and lively discussion and to walk away with some new concepts that are going to make you think about how you too can become a Master!</p>

<h3>PowerBI, from a DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft’s PowerBI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement PowerBI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point PowerBI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, PowerBI, and how to make these work for you.

You will be given permissions to an Azure DB, and get connected to this source. You will also need to have PowerBI desktop downloaded and installed. We will be using this to create the report during the session. So please come prepared to interact with the internet, with a cloud-based database you will be provided, and PowerBI Desk</p>

<h3>Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition who aren't on the new service pack yet. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you wish you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away ... and possibly even after 2016 SP1.</p>
