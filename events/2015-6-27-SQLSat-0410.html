<h3>How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.</p>

<h3>Why should I care about the plan cache?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly).</p>

<h3>Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, we will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.</p>

<h3>Performance Tuning for Mere Mortals Part II</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This is part two of a two part series, looking at performance tuning (i.e. performance troubleshooting) from the beginning. Part II is about the next steps after taking a look at some of the free performance analysis tools. This session will go into more detail about how to capture the current transactions with tools like sp_WhoIsActive stored procedure, Wait Stats, performance counters and Extended Events. 

This is a very demo intensive session some basic issues and performance analysis that will be used as a starting point for performance tuning. 

There will be homework!</p>

<h3>PowerShell for Data Professionals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve heard it said, “If you have to do it twice, automate it.” Cut the learning curve and get a real handle on this powerful automation tool. This session walks you through a dozen scripts to simplify and easily automate time-consuming and tedious elements of your day to day job. This isn’t stuff you’ll use SOMEDAY, these are scripts you can use when you get home tonight. Harness the power of Power Shell to easily find Servers short on space. Script out tables and constraints across all of your databases at once. Backup databases and restore them to a different environment. These tricks and many others will allow PowerShell to simplify your job like no other tool.

<h3>Zero to Hero with PowerShell and SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowerShell is everywhere, and that includes SQL Server. In this session we'll look at using PowerShell with both the SQL Server provider and the SMO (SQL Management Objects) library. Learn how to handle common DBA tasks, such as checking the status of various services, validating backups, and checking for disk usage. You'll also see how to perform developer tasks such as creating tables, inserting records, and querying data. Perhaps most importantly, you will learn how to read and understand the SMO object model, and translate it into PowerShell commands. Come see how to become a hero with SQL Server and PowerShell. </p>

<h3>Getting Started With SQL Server Replication</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will examine how SQL Server replication works.  A technology that has been around, this tool is not going anywhere anytime soon.  It's an excellent way to keep a subset of data synched with another database without having to synch the entire thing (although you could if you wanted to!).  We will examine terms, internals, and walk through the setup of transactional and snapshot replication pieces so you can implement this technology in your environment and use it as a valuable tool in your personal knowledge book.</p>

<h3>Much Ado About Hadoop</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Hadoop is a hot topic right now, and Microsoft is betting that Hadoop and SQL Server will go together like peanut butter and chocolate.  This presentation will spend a little bit of time on the theory behind Hadoop, but the rest will be a demo-driven look at how to get a handle on Hadoop before somebody introduces it into your enterprise.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2014 Column Store Index vNEXT</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Column Store Index functionality released in SQL 2012 did allow for stunning performance gains for OLAP-style queries, but as a v1.0 release it suffered from a number of caveats, limitations, provisos, etc.  The one BIGGIE was that it made it's underlying table NON-UPDATABLE.  Well, that often implementation-killing restriction has been addressed, along with a huge number of other fixes and enhancements.  We will cover what those are and also see actual usage with some nice demos.</p>

<h3>Performance Tuning for Mere Mortals Part I</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this first part of a two part series, we look at performance tuning from the very beginning.  You're a new DBA, you want to be a DBA, or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings. Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  The application is running slowly. Can you help them? Do you even know where to begin to help them?  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow."</p>

<h3>What’s your Imperative doing in my Declarative?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>T-SQL is one of a minority of computer languages where you describe the results rather than code an algorithm.  Unfortunately, many people use habits and constructions learned in imperative languages such as C# or Java when writing T-SQL Code.  In this all-demo session we will explore several such commonly used constructions that are detrimental to SQL Server performance and scalability. </p>

MS SQL Server’s geospatial datatype offers pinpoint accuracy and many advanced location-aware capabilities, such as shapes, overlaps, distances, and direction. The Power Map feature in Office 2013 can turn your addresses and supporting figures into a movie. Turn your facts and figures into a compelling story by entering geospace: the final frontier.</p>

<h3>Know Your Role(s)!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Developers and DBAs naturally conflict with each other over permissions since developers want to be able to fix their code and research issues, but DBAs are the gatekeepers.  In this session we will discuss Microsoft recommended best practices for setting up users and service account permissions.  We will go over common server and database roles and what they actually allow, including roles that should be avoided as potential security loopholes.  He will also look into alternatives for elevated database roles, and easier ways of setting up users across an enterprise environment, all as part of how to consolidate your development servers into fewer instances.</p>
