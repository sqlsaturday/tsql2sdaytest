<h3>Time to Stretch: Scaling out and in with Azure DB Elastic Scale</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Elasticity is one of the main promises of cloud computing. The cloud has given us the ability to programmatically add or remove resources to an application and dynamically respond to our workload volume to allow for cost efficient, high performing solutions. However, achieving this elasticity in a transparent way can be a challenge in itself.

In particular, dynamically scaling the database tier can be difficult due to having to deal with distribution schemes, data movement, application routing and the actual increase or decrease of the database resources. Azure SQL Database and the Elastic Scale .NET API combine to provide a solution to these challenges in an easy to use but powerful set of capabilities. 

In this session we will demo the elastic scale API, elastic db pools, elastic query and elastic database jobs and how they combine to bring database elasticity in your own application and take advantage of true cloud optimized infrastructure!</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2016 Automation with PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DBA’s are constantly faced with challenges in maintaining a healthy SQL Server environment. Monitoring our database servers, deploying database code changes and performing database restores are just a few examples of a day in the life of a DBA. As workloads increase, performing these tasks manually introduces more opportunity for human error and time starts to become our bottleneck. The only option if you want to stay above water is to become more efficient at what you do. Enter automation. Enter PowerShell.

Initially released in 2006, PowerShell has grown to become Microsoft's premier scripting language on the Windows platform. This presentation will begin with a brief overview of the PowerShell language itself, but the primary focus will be on how to interface with SQL Server to help automate your database environment.</p>

<h3>Excel Power Map vs. Power BI Globe Map visualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve crafted your geo data set in Power Query in Excel, then moved it to your Power Pivot model and joined with all other tables. Now you want to visualize your data points using Power Map in Excel or tempted to export your existing data model to Power BI and explore it using Power BI Globe custom visualization. Does Power BI Globe visualization replace the Power Map application in Excel? Can you explore your geo data facts sufficiently using the Power BI Globe only? And do Power BI Globe and Excel Power Map compete with each other or they’re just friends? Let’s try to explore this together.</p>

<h3>SQL Server as a Cloud Service</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The war of the cloud providers continues and database services is one of the many arenas. These services provide a platform that reduces management by trading off detailed control of your underlying OS and hardware.

In this session we will do a comparison of the two most popular platforms for SQL Server: Amazon RDS and Azure SQL Database and explore the strengths and weaknesses of each one.</p>
