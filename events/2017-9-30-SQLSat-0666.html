<h3>Exploring Dark Data with SQL Server 2016 and R [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the addition of R into SQL Server 2016, Microsoft have provided a few extra degrees of freedom for the standard SQL developer. You can now use the R language to wrangle, clean and collect external data, using libraries and functionality that simply wasn’t available to you before with regular T-SQL. Performing data enrichment at scale with SQL Server or even Microsoft R Server can provide extremely valuable new insights for your clients and start reaping the benefits of big data.
     
In this session, Consolidata’s Oliver Frost shows you how to develop your own application for tapping into ‘dark data’. Ollie will demonstrate how to stream live tweets, perform aggregations in R and pipe the output to a Power BI dashboard, giving you a full end-to-end experience of the importance of learning some basic R code in 2016. 
     
This session is for anyone who is new to R and is interesting expanding their skill set beyond their comfort zone in SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Understand the Transaction Log, Unlock Greater Throughput</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Does your application suffer from performance problems even though you followed best practices on schema design? Have you looked at your transaction log? 
There's no doubt about it, the transaction log is treated like a poor cousin. The poor thing does not receive much love. The transaction log, however, is a very essential and misunderstood part of your database. There will be a team of developers creating an absolutely awesome elegant design the likes of which have never been seen before, but the leave the transaction log using default settings. It's as if it doesn't matter, an afterthought, a relic of the platform architecture.
In this session, you will learn to appreciate how the transaction log works and how you can improve the performance of your applications by making the right architectural choices.</p>

<h3>Always On Multi-Site Patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Building robust and resilient Data Platform solutions can be complex and costly, building out for both High Availability and Disaster Recovery. The Always On technologies incorporated in the Microsoft SQL Server stack help Data Platform Engineers to do just this. Creating solutions that span multiple locations, in an effort to protect the data that we are tasked to manage on a daily basis.

Together we will walk through the architecture patterns, technology requirements, and configuration options that you need to know in order to build a solid Data Platform. Understanding the implementation differences between on-premises and cloud based deployments is important. Especially as there are specific requirements that need to be met for up-time SLAs to be applicable, as well as mitigating for region failures.

All of these elements mean that it is more than just simple wizards to follow in order to have a solid, reliable, and robust SQL Server Data Platform.</p>

<h3>Migrating to the cloud options for SQL Server Professionals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, I'll provide an overview of your options when looking to migrate your SQL Server environments to the cloud from either on-site or from another cloud provider. We'll then go through potential cloud infrastructure options such as cloud implementations, compute offerings, and security.

After that we’ll dive into in to an overview of the main cloud providers and providing some examples where they might be a good fit for various SQL Server environments; as well as what you might want to take into consideration during for your migration like your HADR strategy and if your SQL Server data would be better suited in another solution that your chosen cloud provider offers.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2017: Graph Database Inside-Out</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Relational databases has been around since decades. It uses a highly structured schema to store information in tabular form and are optimized to find answers about the data. One of the challenges where relational databases struggle with is to find answers on data relationships.

Graph databases uses graph theory to store information in a collection of nodes and edges. Graph databases are optimized to find answers about the relationships. With graph data processing available in SQL Server 2017 we will get the best of both relational and graph databases in a single product.

In this session the audience will learn about what is graph databases, why graph databases, and how to use the new graph data processing extension of SQL Server 2017.</p>

<h3>Scripting tabular models</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Introducing the new scripting language for tabular models. Before SQL Server 2016 tabular models was wrapped into a multidimensional constructs. TOM is the new native library for tabular - this makes it easy to maintain, modify and deploy your model.

During this session I will go through and explain some examples and best practices on generating a SSAS tabular model by using the new TOM. I will spend some time showing and explaining a real world example on pushing measure creation and changes to the key business stakeholders and to ensure quick time to market.

The last thing i will show is how you speed up your development free up up to 50% of the time you spend building tabular models with the simple and advanced features of Tabular Editor 2.0</p>

<h3>Customizing SQL Server 2016 Mobile Report Publisher</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In Reporting Services 2016 Microsoft introduced support for mobile reports. They also released the Mobile Report Publisher for authoring and creation of mobile reports. 
Developers can create dashboards and KPI and publish them on Reporting Services in a very straightforward way. The downside is that Mobile Report Publisher offers simple features and settings for data visualization and parameterization. 
Nevertheless there are some poor-documented customizations users can apply to have a more flexible products and to determine objects visibility. 
Want to add parameters to a mobile report? Want to add drillthrough and navigation from one report to another? Want to design and import a custom map, for your visualizations?
Want to implement security and filter visibility based on the user's grants? Want to apply a custom layout to your portal?
In this session you'll find the solutions that best fit your needs based on real implementation in a large company.</p>

<h3>Advanced insides into System Versioned Temporal Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 introduces support for system-versioned temporal tables as a database feature that brings built-in support for providing information about data stored in the table at any point in time rather than only the data that is correct at the current moment in time. 

This session takes you behind the basics of Temporal Tables and answers - after a short introduction - the following questions:
- How to handle the change of NULL constraints?
- Can Temporal Tables be renamed and what happens to the System Versioned table?
- What will happen if you change meta data (data length, data type, ...)?
- What happens if you drop a column or add another column to the Temporal Table?
- what about security for the  system versioned table?
- what about calculated columns in the temporal table?
- ...

You are interested in the answers to all the above questions (and more). This session will answer EVERY question about Temporal Tables.</p>

<h3>Next first steps - selected applications of R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You enjoyed the walk-through for R newbies, now you want to take the next steps
and get your eyes and hands on some R code?

Let's elaborate on two topics you might have seen in my "From SQL to R and
beyond" presentation, plus we'll check who obeys Benford's law and who doesn't.

Here are the three subjects that this slightly code-heavy session will cover: 
• How to create dynamic T-SQL using R functions, for example to query your multi-company database 
• Visualizations in R based on shapefiles (those geographic polygons) and some choropleth technique 
• Applying Benford's law, which actually is not about crime and fraud, but may help you to detect them</p>

<h3>Predicting demonic possession using AzureML</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performing exorcisms is a very difficult and time-consuming process. It isn’t always directly clear whether a person is truly possessed by an evil spirit or if we are dealing with a false-positive. What if we can accurately predict if someone is actually possessed before we start the exorcism? This can help us avoid spending valuable resources, like holy water, and avoids possible lawsuits if it turns out an exorcism wasn’t necessary.
In this very special session, created specifically for the six-hundredth-and-sixty-six edition of SQLSaturday, we will use the power of Azure Machine Learning to find out if we can predict demonic possession and bring the worlds of data science and exorcisms closer together!
We will go through all the steps for building a reliably machine learning model together. From analyzing the data to optimizing the model to increase the prediction accuracy. The end result? A machine learning prediction model that will help identify possible possession victims!</p>

<h3>Using object dependencies to develop smart solutions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Imagine you could track down all dependencies between database and related objects. For example: From a KPI in a SSAS Tabular model to a Measure to a Calculated Column, ..., to Data Source View, To Database objects in a Data Warehouse and via a stored procedure or SSIS package to a Staging database or even to the queries into or exports from your source production systems.

Then you could:
- Automatically document your BI or database solution;
- You could prove your data lineage;
- You could generate a deployment script given the SSRS Report, SQL View or Tabular database your users are waiting for to get into production.

But why use your imagination? Just come to see how I did it. I will demo it!
This session is a mix of SQL and SSAS DMV's, T-SQL data models, build tools and some Powershell glue. My goal is to inspire you!</p>

<h3>T-SQL : Bad Habits and Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you are a developer, DBA, or anything in between, chances are you might skip some best practices when you write T-SQL. Unfortunately, many so-called “bad habits” aren’t always obvious, but can lead to poor performance, maintainability issues, and compatibility problems.

In this session, you will learn about several bad habits, how they develop, and how you can avoid them. While we will briefly discuss advice you’ve probably heard before, like avoid SELECT * and be careful with NOLOCK, you will also learn some subtleties in SQL Server that might surprise you, how some shorthand can bite you in the long run, and a very easy way to improve cursor performance.

By changing your techniques and ditching some of these bad habits for best practices, you will take new techniques back to your environment that will lead to more efficient code, a more productive workflow, or both.</p>

<h3>SQL Server  Containers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There's a lot of buzz about containers in tech at the moment but not so much in the SQL Server world which I find odd because as SQL Server people this technology has benefits that we simply shouldn't be ignoring.

My session aims to take attendees through what containers are and how they can benefit us. There are drawbacks which will also be covered but I'm hoping after this session, attendees will be able to go back to their respective companies and be able to evaluate container technology to determine whether or not it will be of benefit.

Attendees will be taken through the following: - 
The definition of containers
Virtual Machines vs Containers
Container networking fundamentals
Configuring Windows Server 2016 to run containers 
Installing the docker engine Pulling SQL images from the docker repository Running SQL Server containers 
Creating custom container images 
A real world implementation of containers</p>

<h3>Query Store without SQL 2016 = Open Query Store</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When SQL Server 2016 was released, it offered a fantastic new feature with the Query Store. Long term, statistics based, query tuning became a reality. But what about the thousands of servers that aren't upgrading to SQL 2016 or newer? The open source project Open Query Store is designed to fulfill that need.

This session will give a short introduction to the Query Store feature in SQL 2016 and then dive into the Open Query Store (OQS) solution. Enrico and William (the co-creators of the OQS project) will explain the design of OQS and demonstrate the features. You will leave this session with an understanding of the features of Query Store and Open Query Store, and a desire to implement OQS in your systems when you return to the office.</p>

<h3>Hash Match, the Operator</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server has a lot of difference execution plan operators. By far the most interesting, and the most versatile, has to be the Hash Match operator.
Hash Match is the only operator that can have either one or two inputs. It is the only operator that can either block, stream, or block partially. And it is one of just a few operators that contribute to the total memory grant of an execution plan.
If you ever looked at execution plans, you will have seen this operator. And you probably have a rough idea of what it does. But do you know EXACTLY what happens when this operator is used? In this 500-level session, we will dive deep into the bowels of the operator to learn how it performs.
It is going to be wild ride, so keep your hands, arms, and legs inside the conference room at all times; and please remain seated until the presenter has come to a full stop.</p>

<h3>Deep dive into Query Store on SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Query Store is a new feature that got released on SQL Server 2016 version and is being improved over the last cumulative updates and on SQL Server 2017 vNext CTP's versions. It's a very useful and interesting feature that allow DBA's ( and non-DBA's :) ) to easily identify performance issues on queries and also allow us to fix it in a fast and simple way. Just the ability to compare a previous execution plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. I want with this session to give you the insight and knowledge to get started using this new and wonderful feature that will change the way how you do performance tuning.</p>

<h3>Hacking SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How easy is it to hack a SQL Server?
In this session we'll see examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), hacking DDM, RLS, and more. 
More important, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants.

<p>Microsoft initially released PowerBI online services which had restriction of developing dashboards and reports online only. Then came the PowerBI desktop for easy onsite development including the complex DAX logics.

PowerBI support to SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services is a major breakthrough for any dashboards without any need to host in the Cloud.

In this session, we will explore and compare the features availale on PowerBI Online Services and PowerBI On-prem SSRS 2016. This session also covers the PowerBI Roadmap for both on-prem and cloud solutions.</p>

<h3>High Availability with SQL Server 2017 on Linux</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most database administrators know how to manage and deploy high availability solutions using SQL Server. Most also know parts of Windows clustering. But with SQL Server 2017 there is a old new kid on the block and it is called Linux. The SQL part might be the same, the operating system is certainly not. In this session we will take a look at high availability solutions on Linux and how they fit into SQL Server. How do you manage and deploy availability groups across your organization leveraging Linux. But also, what is new with SQL Server 2017 on Linux as well as Windows.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Pester - TDD for PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Start from nothing and use Test Driven Development to write a PowerShell function that uses the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to analyse pictures.

I will take you on a journey from nothing to a complete function, making sure that all of the code works as expected, is written according to PowerShell best practices and has a complete help system.

You will leave this session with a good understanding of what Pester can do and a methodology to develop your own PowerShell functions</p>

<h3>A Look Inside SQL Server Distribution Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Where do the estimated rowcount values come from? Look inside SQL Server’s distribution statistics to see how they are used to come up with the estimates. We’ll also discuss changes in the cardinality estimator in recent versions and look at some new metadata that gives us more statistics information.

Goals:
•	Explore the output of DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS
•	Describe when the density information is useful
•	Look at some problem scenarios for which the statistics can’t give good estimates
•	Understand why cardinality estimation involves more than just the statistics</p>

<p>With over 10 years of experience with SQL Server my knowledge goes a long way. But there is always room for more. That's the reason why I love to help people face and solve their everyday or incidental challenges. This helps me to get more out of SQL Server. My main role is as a DBA but I love to hang around in Visual Studio and not afraid to take you up on a discussion about ADO.NET or the Entity Framework.</p>
