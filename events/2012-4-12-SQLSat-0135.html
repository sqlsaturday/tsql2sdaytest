<h3> BI Architecture with SQL 2012  SharePoint 2010</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we'll cover new BI features in SQL Server 2012 including Power View, Tabular BISM, Report Alerts and SSRS Integration with SharePoint Server 2010. We'll then focus on the importance of Self-Service BI and how it fits into an overall enterprise Business Intelligence architecture. This session will be rich with demos of all the key BI tools, and will also cover installation and configuration on both new and existing Sharepoint farms. We'll also cover securely extending BI solutions over the internet, touching on Kerberos Delegation and Threat Management Gateway (TMG). Come along and discover the awesome power of the latest release of the Microsoft BI Platform.</p>

<h3>3D Glasses for SQL Server Error Logs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we explore the full potential of the SQL Server Error Log.   The error log is painful to sift through at best, so we turn to Business Intelligence to provide us with an insightful 30,000 view of the error log, and will be amazed at what we can see !</p>

<h3>Better Together: Merge, Partitioning, ColumnStore </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most SQL Server sessions are based around individual features but SQL Server really shines when you start to combine features. In this session, Greg will provide an introduction to ColumnStore indexes, review Table Partitioning and Merge and show how to combine these features to improve query performance while still being able to load data warehouse data quickly.</p>

<h3>Tabular Modelling and Design Concepts</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Analysis Service in SQL2012 introduces the Vertipac engine and the tabular model.  While the tabular model is delivered through SSAS, the model offers some unique design opportunities for users who would otherwise design a dimensional OLAP solution.  This session looks at tabular modelling by comparing it to the multidimensional model.  We address some of the advantages, considerations and restrictions of the tabular model and examine how the limitations of the native model can be overcome with DAX (the tabular query language). </p>

<h3>Query Tuning Using Lessons Learned from SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I'm sure you've noticed the similarities between an execution plan and an SSIS Data Flow Task. Of course there are major differences, such as the fact that you write Data Flow Tasks, whereas execution plans are created based on the T-SQL that you pass to the Query Optimizer and other things such as indexes, statistics and constraints. This talk will consider some of the things that SSIS developers look for when creating an effective Data Flow Task, and show you how those same concerns can be considered when writing queries.</p>

<h3>The MERGE Statement - T-SQL's Swiss Army Knife</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Despite being around since SQL Server 2008 MERGE is one of the most underappreciated features in T-SQL. In many ways it's the Swiss Army Knife, able to be used in many different situations. It's not without it's frustrations though, and you'll see both sides of this useful tool in this presentation.</p>

<h3>The Dark Art of Performance Tuning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Despite all of the enhancements to the instrumentation in SQL Server, many database professionals still view performance tuning as a dark art.  This session will provide database administrators and developers with valuable information on SQL Server performance tuning concepts.  This presentation will walk you through proven performance tuning strategies and teach you how to use SQL Server tools to identify a performance bottleneck, isolate the root cause, apply possible resolutions, and then quantify performance improvements.</p>

<h3>Visualising  your data with PivotViewer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Discover the power of PivotViewer, the Silverlight control that enables users to visualise large data sets in an extremely effective and tangible way. Quickly filter, sort and see how your data relates to each other in a way that traditional reports cannot. This session will cover what the  PivotViewer control is and how to get the most out of it with your own data. Even if you've used PivotViewer before, see what's new in the recent Silverlight 5 version to enable you to make the most out of your collections.</p>

<h3>Introducing Contained Databases in SQL Server 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Portability and tempdb collation conflicts are challenges currently faced with traditional databases.  SQL Server 2012 introduces a new feature called Contained Databases that overcomes these challenges.  This session is an introduction to Contained Databases and will look at the different types of containment; how to create, connect to and manage a contained database; and database portability made easy.</p>

<h3>Keeping the light's on with SQL 2012 Always On</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we'll cover how HA  DR is currently utlised and some misgivings. We'll then introduce the capabilities of Always On in SQL Server 2012 and how these can benefit your existing solution. This presentation will be rich with demo's covering installation and configuration of your Always On environment.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting SQL Issues using Ring Buffers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will showcase the hidden treasures that are within SQL Server Ring Buffers and how they can be used to troubleshoot SQL Server issues. The session provides a demonstration of how to identify SQL exceptions, connection failures and SQL Server memory issues.</p>

<h3>Analytic T-SQL Functions in 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are a bunch of new T-SQL functions in SQL Server 2012, and as usual  there's a combination of the "this is really useful" and the "...but there's a caveat". In this presentation, Rob will take you through the new analytic functions, show you how they seriously enhance your reporting ability, and show you some of the ways that they don't behave the way you might expect. You may not be using SQL Server 2012 yet, but you're bound to recognise some of the problems that these functions solve.</p>

<h3>If you had $10K what would you spend it on?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You are looking at the Bill of Materials for the new shiny server that you are going to purchase for SQL Server and you realise that there is still $10,000 in the hardware budget - how do you spend it?  Do you increase the core density, maybe increase the RAM or maybe even look at adding some solid state storage to the storage array.  In this session we will explore how some small hardware investments made in the right place can pimp your next SQL Server deployment.
