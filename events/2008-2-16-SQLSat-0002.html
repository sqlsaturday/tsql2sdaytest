<h3>Writing Determinate Functions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Determinate functions (also called characteristic functions) were originally used before SQL introduced the case statement. They allow you to make decisions mathematically, rather than with logic, which can make code dramatically faster. This session is not for people afraid of simple algebra.</p>

<h3>Managing SSIS Packages</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The key to long term success of SSIS based systems is a planned approach to configuration management and deployment. A carefully architected approach can simplify the management of the many variables within an organization that affect the functioning of these packages. These variables include server name, database names and file system, among others. In this session on management and deployment of SSIS, we will identify most of these variables that support our packages. Later, strategies for man</p>

<h3>Persisting and Tracking Workflows Using SqlServer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SqlServer plays an important role for out-of-the-box tracking and persisting workflows. Without persistence, workflows could not handle processes that run over long periods of time. Without tracking information about a workflow as it runs, they can sometimes become black boxes while they run. This session will focus on getting DBA's up to speed with what is happening under the hood and what is required to wire up these services within SQLServer.</p>
