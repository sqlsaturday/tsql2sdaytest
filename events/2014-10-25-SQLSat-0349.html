<h3>The Augean Stables:  Data Cleansing in the Modern Enterprise</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every database professional knows the database design ideal and we have all seen that ideal on numerous occasions -  databases in perfect third normal form;  constraints and relational integrity rigorously enforced; elegant error handling in every SQL statement;  data so clean you can eat off it.

Unfortunately we’ve only seen this ideal in textbooks and sample databases designed by vendors.  

The databases we see in the real world are… less than ideal shall we say.  Of course, we use other phrases for what we see but human resources frowns on such terms and this is, after all, a family friendly presentation.  
Database professionals in Greece circa 600 BCE may have access to the Alpheus and Peneus rivers to cleanse their particular stables but we modern folks need to rely on the tools on our own computers such as SQL and SSIS.  Mike will review various techniques and tools for data cleansing that will help you wash away the muck to get to the data gold standard.

<h3>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</p>

<h3>The Lost Science of Set Theory</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.</p>

<h3>Understanding Your Processes Through Operation Intelligence</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business processes can get large and complex. So much so, that no one can understand each piece of the puzzle that makes the entire process work. This talk will be on how we put into place ways to capture the events of the processes so that we can more effectively understand and troubleshoot the system. This also allows us to perform further analysis (drilling down into details of the process, time patterns to see trends in how long a certain action takes, root cause analysis, and processing load analysis). This can also help people understand the many steps that can go into a business process.</p>

<h3>Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

<h3>Reporting Services for Mere DBAs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a DBA in the modern era, you may be required from time to time to do something outside of your comfort zone.  One of these things may be to become quickly acquainted with SSRS.  Even better is that you may be required to do things you have not considered in a standard report.  In this session, you will learn how to implement a framework to help provide a common ground for your reports.  This session will delve into fun topics such as dynamic grouping and dynamic sorting.  We are not talking about the interactive sorting that your accountant may use.  Attendees will also be introduced to a few quick methods of exporting Reports from the report server - this is from a DBA perspective after-all!</p>

<h3>Unstructured Data  Deep Learning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many companies are trying to still figure out just how sophisticated they need to be about their data. While companies like Narrative Science ($29M raised), InsideSales.com ($143M raised), and many others aim to bring advanced analytics as a service deeply integrated into their products. Together we'll take a look at the cost/benefit of going from a simple classifier to a more complex deep learning approach to keyword relevance in a simple proof of concept around predicting and optimizing responses in email and tweets.</p>

<h3>Database Release Management: Tips to help organize it</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The very nature of a database system is to be dynamic; rarely static. The applications that use databases tend to change, requiring changes to occur within our databases.  The totality of pieces and parts that comprise this ‘change’ will be combined into a ‘Release’ that will be applied to your systems. Controlling this change is not rocket science, but it is not without its complexities. We will discuss various terms, define processes, share ideas, and suggest tools to assist you in performing this necessary function, while minimizing risk, and impacting your systems in a graceful fashion.</p>

<h3>Simple things you can do to make  the Query Optimizer more efficient!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>On occasion as DBAs we have need to disable the foreign keys and constraints on one or more tables. Guess what, SQL Server no longer trusts those constraints when you re-enable them. What does that mean? In this discussion, we’ll talk about what the impact is to your queries when you have non-trusted constraints, how to find the non-trusted constraints, and how to soothe SQL Servers mistrusting heart so that it will trust your constraints again! How about your foreign keys? Are you using implicit conversions? Are your stats 'stale'? All of these things effect how the query optimizer works and can negatively affect you query performance. </p>

<h3>Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.</p>

<h3>Understanding SQL Server XML Features </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server. </p>
