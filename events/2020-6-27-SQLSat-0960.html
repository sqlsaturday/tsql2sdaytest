<h3>From Stutterer to Speaker: Overcoming Your Fears</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you terrified of public speaking? For 37 years of my life, I was too! That paralyzing fear of public communication held me back and kept me taking from taking advantage of career and community opportunities that came my way - and I've heard this story from many. Now, when I speak at community events, I'm often asked how I got into speaking and how I got over my fears of public speaking. In this free-wheeling session I'll tell you the tips and tricks that I took to heart to go from a kid in speech therapy to somebody that volunteers to speak in front of people and actually enjoys it. Most importantly, I'll talk about how improved personal and public communication can give your career a massive boost in this time of rapid growth in the data professional realm. I sincerely hope this session helps encourage people to overcome their fears of public and small group speaking - or that you at least enjoy making fun of pictures of 6-year-old me in speech therapy headphones!</p>

<h3>Why Learn Python?  A Microsoft DB/ETL/BI Developer's Answer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You're a Microsoft Developer.  C#, MSSQL, SSIS/SSRS, SSMS, and Azure are your tools of choice.  Why would you want to learn Python?  In this session, I will show you several take-home utilities that use Python.  The first hunts through a folder structure full of SSIS packages looking for the one(s) that load(s) a specified table.  The second executes the data sources in an SSRS report to identify performance problems and document them in Excel.  The third GeoCodes the City/Country names from a SQL table, getting the Lat/Lng so you can use the data in maps.  Familiarity with Python is not necessary to use the utilities, but we're not going to do Hello World either.  This is real Python for Microsoft Database, ETL and BI Developers.  This all-demo session shows you how to use Python with the .Net CLR,  XML, ODBC, Excel, SQL Server, and Web API calls.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure for the Data Professional: An Introduction</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.</p>

<h3>What You Need To Know About Processing Tabular Models and Power BI Datasets</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wondered what's happening under the covers when processing a tabular model or a Power BI dataset? Why is it taking so much memory? How can I make it run faster? Am I running into a resource bottleneck?

Processing a tabular model can be a very resource-intensive workload and depending on your specific goals (e.g. speed, availability, etc) it may not always be feasible to process the entire model.

In this session, you'll learn what actually happens and in what order during model processing, the difference between the various processing types, performance considerations and most common resource bottlenecks. We'll also cover the most common processing patterns and the associated trade-offs.

Keywords: Analysis Services, SSAS, Power BI</p>

<h3>Azure-d Availability: SQL Server HA In and To the Cloud</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Has your manager come to you and said "I expect the SQL Server machines to have zero downtime?" Have you been told to make your environment "Always On" without any guidance (or budget) as to how to do that or what that means? Are you facing pressure to have data in Azure as well? Help is here! This session will walk you through the high availability options in on-premises SQL Server, the high availability options in Azure SQL Database and Managed Instances, and how some or all of those can be combined to enable you to achieve the ambitious goals of your management. Beyond the academic knowledge, we'll discuss frequently seen scenarios from the field covering exactly how your on-premises environments and Azure services can work together to keep your phone quiet at night.</p>

<h3>Learn How to Master DATETIME Functions Like a Boss in 59.5 Minutes or Less</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>- Do you know the dates of the 1st Monday, 2nd Tuesday, 3rd Wednesday, and 4th Thursday of any month between the 22 weeks and 47 weeks of any given year? 

- Do you know the date that Daylight Savings starts in Nashville 4 years from now?

Those two questions may have been a trivial but there is nothing trivial about working within the complexity of dates and times. Trains, Planes, and sometimes at automobile races depend on precise and accurate date-time recordings. 

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will answer the following questions and more:
- When to use DATETIME and DATETIME2 and why.
- How do you filter date ranges that will make SQL Server run faster?
- How language and date formatting affect EVERYTHING.
- What's the best way to work with functions relating to the current date and time.
- What's the best way to properly use SWITCHOFFSET, TODATETIMEOFFSET and AT TIME ZONE Functions. 

So stop wasting time and get on board because it's about time for the plane to depart.</p>

<h3>Real-World PowerShell for SQL Administration</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you're like me, you've attended PowerShell sessions before. However, much of the *practical* usage of PS comes with rolling back your sleeves and digging into the nuances of syntax and how to get things done. We are going to focus specifically on using PowerShell within the SQL Server Agent to build out everyday jobs.

In this session, I'm assuming that you know the basics of PowerShell. What we're going to cover are some of the "gotchas" and nuances that I've run into when I've been working with the language, and particularly with the SQL Agent's flavor of PowerShell.

And then we'll spend the balance of our time looking at real-world, practical scripts that I use pretty much every day. PowerShell is an awesome way to automate so many processes and relieve some of the everyday monotony of SQL administration.</p>

<h3>The Art of Data Classification and Protection</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Government regulations are increasing! Data breaches are being reported almost daily. Do you know what type of data is in the database and what data should be classified?  
In this session, we will learn why and how to classify the data in our databases.  SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) has options to help us classify data. Let’s go into depth and see how to use the Data Discovery and Classification tool along with the Information Protection Policy tool found inside SSMS. Once the data is classified, let’s report on the data we classified. Lastly, let’s set up auditing and find out who is accessing the classified data.
You will leave the session with a clear understanding of how to properly classify, report and audit the newly classified data, allowing us to better adhere to compliance regulations. 
Prerequisites: Having an understanding of data privacy regulation is recommended and a desire to learn how to protect data with which you have been entrusted.</p>

<h3>5 Surprising Lessons Every SQL Server Generalists Has to Learn</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Maybe you are an accidental DBA who has recently been assigned responsible for the SQL Server, on-premises or in the Azure cloud. Maybe you are a generalist who can keep the SQL Server up and running, but don’t know much about how it works. Or maybe you are just starting in your career and want to learn more. Whatever situation applies to you, there are handful of very important lessons you will have to learn if you administrate a SQL Server. Whether you learn them the easy way, by study or by attending this session, or the hard way, by experiencing these problems first hand, is your choice.

In the session, your speaker takes you through five surprising situations where what you don’t know WILL hurt you. Learn them in advance so you are not surprised by them and remain in control when the eventually occur. You also see demos and overviews of native features within SQL Server that explain these concepts, as well as free community tools that can make your job easy and your life better.</p>

<h3>How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any area that may be impacting performance or security.  If you have more than one DBA, it is also important to have all the DBA team members review the same areas when completing an assessment.  During this session we will discuss when assessments are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. This session will also cover how to document your findings and recommendations.</p>

<h3>Looking "Normal" and Seeing "Stars": Table Designs Working Together</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most database professionals know there are two different database design patterns - normal forms for OLTP databases and star schemas for data warehouses. We tend to discuss these separately. But these two designs actually work together when we create our table schemas.

In this session, we will review the basics of both normal forms and star schemas. We'll compare and contrast the two designs. We will then discuss how a normalized database design influences a star schema design and vice versa. 

By the end of the session, you will better understand how using the two designs together gives you a greater insight to how you use your data throughout its lifecycle.</p>

<h3>The function of Windowing Functions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the past, we have all had the need to return a result set and provide information on this with regard to a persons previous or future records.  Or, alternatively, you have needed to get a single record for an individual - maybe the first, maybe the last.  Doing this without windowing functions is possible but why punish yourself?!  Come to learn about general windowing functions that we should all know, as well as some that you may not be aware of!  Did you know you can use count(*) as a windowed function in addition to general aggregate?</p>

<h3>Give Power [BI] to the people - securely share your insights</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every organization is a data organization and you must collaborate on data to stay on track. Sharing insights from within Power BI will give you an advantage and help steer your organization in the right direction.
However there are some pitfalls with sharing - if you don’t know your options and set proper governance, you could be on your way to leaking data to outside your company.

In this session, you will get a short introduction to Power BI and understand where data resides, why and how you should share with your colleagues and outside partners, and a strategy for setting governance on sharing your data. You will walk away with the outline of a governance plan, an understanding of your sharing options, and the sharing settings you should immediately turn off.</p>

<h3>Achieve Enterprise Scale with Advanced SQL Server Features</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You have an OLTP database application which sustains a heavy mixed workload with lots of read and write transactions at the same time that it reports data base to a client application. Performance was fine for a long time, but it is not meeting your needs now that it must scale to much higher workloads. What should you do? In this real-world case study, you’ll learn about a series of technologies that provide unprecedented scalability, including data compression, In-Memory OLTP, and clustered-partitioned columnstore indexes. We will walk you through a chronology of the application and database architecture, its changes over time, and the degree of performance improvement achieved with each new SQL Server feature applied. This session will teach you all about planning and implementing advanced SQL Server performance features and how each one impacts your system performance for applications with 100’s or 1000’s of concurrent users.</p>
