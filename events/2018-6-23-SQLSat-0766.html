<h3>Securing SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A default SQL Server installation is reasonably secure, but quot;reasonably securequot; doesn't cut it in an era in which one bad line of code, one weak password, or one open port can result in your customer database ending up on Pastebin. In this talk, we will look at different methods of securing a SQL Server instance, from venerable (principle of least privilege, Transparent Data Encryption) to novel (Always Encrypted, row-level security). These tools and techniques will show us ways for developers, database administrators, and network specialists to work together to secure SQL Server instances.</p>

<h3>Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.</p>

<h3>Cloudy DBA, Amazon (AWS) and SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google or whatever else out there) is a reality now and for most of the organizations question is not "if", it is "When". 

Cloud has and will continue to transform DBA's role from tactical to strategic. We will start our session with a quick discussion about Cloudy DBA and cloud computing fundamentals. 

After that we will dive deep into Amazon and explore different options for running SQL Server database in AWS. We will compare available options, evaluate their differences and suitability for different workloads. We will also cover cloud migration approaches, connectivity, AD Authentication, backup and recovery, performance, monitoring, HA/DR, security, compliance, licensing and related best practices.</p>

<h3>Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!</p>

<h3>How to transition from Profiler to Extended Events and why you should consider.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let me ask you, what comes to your mind when you hear / read phrase SQL Server Extended Events? You may be thinking: "What is it, what does it do?", "I don’t have time to learn this", "I already have the tool that does all I need", "It’ll require too much coding", "There is no way Extended Events can do what SQL Profiler does."
Why don’t we take a closer look using straightforward examples in order to figure out what it’s all about, because learning Extended Events is fun and easy.

In this session we will cover the following:
-- How to create an extended event session using an existing trace.
-- How to create XE (Extended Events) in UI (User interface) from the ground up.
-- How to analyze the data.
-- What to watch out for in terms of performance.</p>

<h3>Patterns for Managing Your Career Learning Needs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most of us want to "keep up" with changes in the technologies we use and most of us feel like we're failing to do so. Can that be right? Is it possible to learn what what we need to learn in order to stay current and still have time for a life outside of work? It is!

This presentation is about patterns you can apply to how and when you learn. My goal is to give you the ideas and techniques that will help you learn effectively and do so for your entire career - something you can use for 40 years!

Attendees - bring your lists. Bring the list of stuff of you want to learn or think you should learn. Take a few minutes to write down the challenges you've had in 'keeping up'. We'll discuss some during the session and I'll be available afterward for one on one conversations for the rest!</p>

<h3>Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server and Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/2017 and Azure SQL DB with predicate based RLS and in Power BI, as well.

This session will show how organizational  asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/2017, Azure SQL Database and Power BI without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations.

Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS.</p>

<h3>Tuning Like CSS: With These Tools There's No Need Call Support</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What do you do when you have a performance or troubleshooting problem that you can’t figure out? One option is to open a support ticket with Microsoft Support (CSS). The CSS engineer will use a specific set of tools to collect and analyze workload data from your SQL Server. Based on this information they might recommend patches, configuration changes, or identify the worst-performing queries.
 
But what if you could bypass support and do all of this analysis yourself?
 
In this session, you'll learn how to use battle tested tools to analyze your workload and error logs. Armed with this information, you'll understand the root cause of the problem and propose solutions to performance and stability problems.</p>

<h3>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.</p>

<h3>A DBA's guide to full stack performance troubleshooting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Factory V2 and SSIS Automation With Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSIS was originally designed to work in a world where all data was structured and on premise. As modern enterprise data projects increasingly move online, tools like Azure Data Factory (ADF) can extend SSIS capabilities to the cloud. Azure Data Factory is a flexible and powerful cloud based ETL service, but it doesn't replace the functionality of SSIS. 

In this session you will learn the advantages and disadvantages of both ETL platforms; how to use both in tandem to maximize productivity; and how both ETL platforms, as well as any supporting structures, can be be automatically generated with Biml Script. 

All of the code used in this presentation can be downloaded by attendees, customized, and used in their production environments.</p>

<h3>That's bad mkay!  (How to quantify when things aren't right)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We've all heard that things like nested views, cursors, and under/over-indexed tables are bad...but why?  What is the real cost of the badness that abounds in the database world?  What's really going on when you run that query against a view of a view of a view.  How can you quantify what happens when that cursor ends up running the same simple query thousands of times.  And how can indexes really impact the way SQL Server decides to solve your queries.  In this session we'll talk about the basics of how to read query plans and use extended events to understand why all these things can be big resource drains on a SQL Server.  Good times should be had by all.</p>

<h3>CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</p>

<h3>Change Detection in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Change detection is a critical component of any system that moves data from one structure to another. Most data movement mechanisms are designed to move a subset of the data – only that which is new or changed since the last load. For that to work properly, there must be a reliable system for detecting delta data touched since the most recent load. 

In this session, we will review the tools and design patterns available in SQL Server for performing change detection. From source detection methods including change tracking and change data capture, to in-flight comparisons using hashed values, and even brute-force methods as a last resort, we’ll cover the spectrum of change detection tools in SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Loading a Data Warehouse with SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data warehouses and ETL processes are an essential part of business decision-making. In an age where big data and NoSQL solutions, traditional data warehouse architectures and ETL tools to feed them (such as SQL Server Integration Services) remain critical to providing reliable, repeatable, and auditable answers.

SQL Server Integration Services has evolved into an ideal tool for loading data warehouses. Its modular design and variety of load tools allow it to process most any data warehouse load design (full load, incremental load, or near real-time), while its data flow transformations and scripting tools make it flexible enough to handle complex reshaping and cleansing required of data warehouse loads.

In this session, we will discuss and demonstrate loading a data warehouse using SQL Server Integration Services. We will briefly cover some ETL best practices for data warehouse loads, and will demonstrate how these practices can be implemented using SSIS.</p>

<h3>GDPR: How it impacts companies outside of Europe</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>GDPR takes (took) effect on May 25th, 2018. Many companies  have overlooked the implication of GDPR because they think it only affects customers in Europe.

So, if there's a chance that you are collecting information from someone who is a citizen of any other EU Country, you are impacted. In this session, we will discuss all of the ways that you may be impacted and the steps you should be taking to become compliant before the fines start being collected.</p>

<h3>Migration Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you've got SQL Server instances that need to be moved off of old hardware or need a version upgrade for functionality and support purposes.  Where do we begin?  What pieces do we need to consider and how are we going to get them moved?  What kind of window do we need to move everything?

We'll cover all of these things and more, as well as querying the attendees on what to do next during certain steps to ensure you have your mind in the right place.  Migrations can be tedious, but if planned properly, they can be easy and expand your knowledge for SQL Server.

<h3>Trusting your data</h3>

<h3>Consistent Deployments / Team Development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Unless you are developing code by yourself, you face challenges of working with several team members. Different people are changing code which affects the code someone else is working on. In addition, there will be teams working on different projects at the same time.  In the middle of the projects, an emergency fix needs to be deployed to Production. So where is the code, when do you shared it with others, when do you get the code that has been shared, where is the production code branch located.  How do I branch and when do merge? How do I get a release branch? Let me share with you how we are handling this area of DevOps.</p>

I spent the next 14 years as a mainframe system programmer for two state agencies. In 1996 I moved to Healthcare IT and have been that ever since. I’ve spent most of the past 14 years doing ETL, performance and HIPAA security. In these various jobs, I’ve used all manner of databases including InfoTec IMP, IBM VSAM and DB2, Interbase, Informix, Universe, Oracle 9i and SQL Server from 6.0 to 2008 R2.</p>

<p>Franklin Gamboa, MCSE, inició su carrera como desarrollador de Java, pero luego de poco tiempo se mudó al mundo del .Net, y luego a ser DBA de SQL Server, y ha estado en la plataforma de datos desde entonces. Mientras era arquitecto de bases de datos, hacía apps por diversión, ya que eso le ayudaba a entender las necesidades de los desarrolladores. Eventualmente, ingresa al equipo de CSS para SQL Server en Costa Rica.

Ha dado charlas en Estados Unidos y para algunos SQL Server user groups de Costa Rica.</p>
