<h3>Troubleshooting Issues with Extended Events in real time</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration specially when you don't have any benchmarking data for troubleshooting issues. In this session, we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time. We will demonstrate how this feature enables new possibilities to capture real time problems without enabling any third party tools or inbuilt SQL Server features to capture issues like blocking,  deadlocks, high CPU and many more.
Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008 but by SQL Server 2016, it has enhanced significantly. After this session, hopefully you will start using extended event, if you haven't started using till now.</p>

<h3>DBATools! The reason to finally start learning and using Powershell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Powershell has been part of Windows for > 10 years and has been part of SQL Server since 2008.
In spite of this the adoption among Database Professionals for use in investigating and managing their environments has been low.

With the release of the open source DBA Tools module from DBATools.IO, with its 300+ commands, the time has arrived for Database Professionals to embrace PowerShell and upgrade their skills to support the modern Hybrid environment.

In this session we will look how to download, install and begin using the power within both this module and Powershell.

No prior experience with Powershell required!</p>

<h3>DevOPs and the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.

In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running database hosted in Azure the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.</p>

<h3>When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we would not need any error handling, because there would be no errors. But in the real world we need to have error handling in our stored procedures. Error handling in SQL Server is a most confusing topic, because there are such great inconsistencies. But that does not mean that we as database developers can hide our head in the sand.

This presentation starts with a horror show of the many different actions SQL Server can take in case of an error. We will then learn how should deal with this - what we should do and what we should not and that with SET XACT_ABORT we get better consistency. We will learn how TRY-CATCH works in SQL Server, and we will get a recipe for how to write CATCH blocks. More generally, we will learn why it pays off to be simple-minded to survive in this maze. The session mainly looks at traditional T-SQL code, but the session ends with a quick look at natively compiled stored procedures, where everything is different.</p>

<h3>A Beginners Guide to HA/DR</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) planning is not just about the technology. When thinking or talking about High Availability/Disaster Recovery, many people jump straight to a particular technology without understanding other factors impacting the solution, and then waste time working backwards to understand requirements. Recovery Objectives, SLA’s and budget are some of the commonly overlooked factors when planning and developing a HA/DR solution. In this session we will walk through the 6 building blocks I take into account when developing a HA/DR solution. You can then use this same methodology to implement High Availability and/or Disaster Recovery in your own environment, working forward to determine the right technology.</p>

<h3>Data Privacy and the Data Professional.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s almost a daily occurrence to hear about some sort of data breach. 
But what are the consequences of a data breach – for both the victims and companies involved – and what does that mean for you as a data professional.
As governments start to legislate more in an effort to protect the privacy of its citizens the entire concept of data storage become more complex.
Exactly what is legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how will it affect around the world.
We’re seen Microsoft give us tools over the years – like Transparent Data Encryption and Dynamic Data masking - to help with this sort of thing – but is there a better answer?
Come along to this session and hear how you and your team can lessen your chances of being the ones responsible for the next data breach.</p>

<h3>GDPR - What is it? Why should I care?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU legal initiative taking effect in May 2018, which protects data held anywhere by anyone on EU citizens. Why should you care about a new law from the other side of the planet? Because we live in an inescapably interconnected world. 

This legislation comes with painful penalties for those who don't comply. As a data professional, you will need to be aware of its implications for your organisation and the data which it holds.

This is a high-level look at the requirements of and obligations arising from GDPR for application designers and data professionals. 

For specific guidance for your company, please seek specialised legal advice. I am not a lawyer. I am only qualified to utter my own opinions.</p>

<h3>Using SQL as the basis for analysis in Python - Walking through an example on Kiwisaver in NZ</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What percentage of people in New Zealand have a KiwiSaver account? Who is more likely to have one, and who is less? How is KiwiSaver participation affected by the fact that the money can be withdrawn to buy a home, especially given that the housing market is currently very difficult to enter into? 

These questions can be answered using SQL within Python to join  summarise data from multiple sources, and subsequently performing some analysis and data visualisation in Python. 

KiwiSaver has been around since 2007, but how much do we really know about its impact? Analysing this further requires gathering data from various sources and shaping it so that it is ready to be combined using SQL. The classifications used by different data sources needs to be addressed before choosing appropriate SQL joins.

Once this is done, we can calculate new summary statistics using SQL within Python. These then form the basis of the analysis and visualisation that can be performed in Python.</p>

<h3>The Smart Way to Troubleshoot SQL Server Always On Cluster and Av</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances (FCI) and Availability Groups (AG) depend a lot on Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC). But when mission-critical databases go offline, bringing them back online could be a nerve-wracking experience.

This session will look at understanding how the underlying WSFC platform works to help us maintain availability of our databases. This is for DBAs and systems administrators who are responsible for administering SQL Server FCIs and AGs but are not so comfortable with figuring out why the databases went offline and what they can do about it. We’ll walk thru the troubleshooting process that I follow to quickly identify and resolve SQL Server FCI and AG availability issues.</p>

<h3>What do you mean there are no maintenance Windows?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Imagine you develop for, or manage, a database system that powers a platform that must be operational 24/7/365.  There are users worldwide every minute of the day.
Need to update a schema to support an application change? Since the old versions of the app will still be using the database during update, you can’t do a breaking change until after the new app is rolled out everywhere.
How do you do fit index maintenance in when there is constantly a heavy workload?  What about backups?
In this session we’re going to look at real world problems faced by many organisations and some ways to "work around them"</p>
