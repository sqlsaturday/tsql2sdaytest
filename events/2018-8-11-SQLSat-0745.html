<h3>Building the HASSP: Putting SQL Server In Space</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In today's world, technology is a pervasive part of our lives. We have "smart" appliances everywhere: from cars, thermostats, and even refrigerators contain built-in systems to collect, store, and transmit data. Small embedded devices can also be used for scientific purposes as well, offering new and exciting ways to collect data for studies or projects at home.

The High-Altitude SQL Server Project, or HASSP, is one such project.

The HASSP team has created a high-altitude balloon that uses sensors to collect various data points and store the results in an embedded version of SQL Server!

In this session, you'll hear about how this is possible: we'll discuss the hardware used, the custom device that we built, and the software used to make it all work together. Best of all, you'll see how to recreate (and hopefully improve!) the project on your own.</p>

<h3>Ten Things Power BI Can Do for Your Business</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the world of data, we spend much of our time talking about software, and for good reason: the modern wave of tools is dramatically superior to the tools of even five years ago. But there’s a related question that bears revisiting: WHAT should we be doing with those tools? While that may seem like an obvious question, the very existence of the revolutionary new tools makes now a great time to revisit the fundamentals of how we view our relationship with data. 

Spoiler alert: many of the obvious valuable things were prohibitively difficult to execute using previous tools – so much so that we’ve forgotten what we should be doing! The speaker (Rob Collie) has seen it all in the process of helping literally hundreds of organizations revolutionize their relationships with data, and in this thought-provoking and non-technical talk, he will share 10 recurring and valuable patterns observed within the past 2-3 years.</p>

<h3>Getting started with Machine Learning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have large amounts of data which you want to leverage to predict the answers to difficult questions?  The seemingly new field of Machine Learning (ML) has been around for almost 60 years, with this exact goal in mind. 

In this session, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of ML, to get you started without requiring a mathematics background.  We will look at how to “frame” your data questions, as well as understanding the type of outputs ML can provide in responding with predictions.   Focus will be placed on the high-level overview of the ML process, and spend time on the simple steps of determining the “right” algorithm to use.  Tools used include Weka and Azure ML Studio, but the focus of the session is on fundamentals and the ML process, not specific toolsets.</p>

<h3>Inside the SQLServer PowerShell Module</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQLPS has been evolving since 2012 and the SQL Provider/cmdlets have been around since 2008. Have you taken advantage of the PowerShell infrastructure that is on your servers? This session takes you behind the scenes of the SQLPS and the new SqlServer module that is installed with the tools. We will cover how to get it without the tools, how to use it once you have it and why you will want to use it for simple tasks or complex ones. When you learn how to navigate SQL Server and all its services using Paths, you won't go back. Join me for a fun filled hour and learn how to keep SQLPS from becoming frustrating and a black box. You will be glad you did. Let's continue the journey to becoming a PowerShell DBA.</p>

<h3>Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.</p>

<h3>Relax! It's just DAX.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DAX is the language you use when working in Power BI or Power Query to create calculations using your data. 
At first, it may seem intimidating, but the truth is that if you have been using functions in Excel, you have the basic knowledge to help you get started in DAX.
The first half of this session will introduce basic DAX terminology and concepts. In the second half, participants can use their own laptop and work on a demo data set, creating some beginner DAX statements. 
The experts in DAX say that DAX is an easy language to learn, and a hard language to master. DAX may be easy to learn (although that hasn't been this speaker's experience!), but it is definitely hard to carve out a chunk of time to try out a new skill. This is your chance! At the end of the session, I will also share a list of resources, including books, videos, and blogs for you to continue your journey into DAX.</p>

<h3>Database Design Fundamentals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.</p>

<h3>Taking the pain out of database migrations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Database migrations are scary. The migration of a database has many moving pieces and things to think about. Some of those things have nothing to do with the DBA and are outside of their control. However, if these items are not taken into account, it is the DBA that management will hold responsible for the failure. 

This session will discuss what you need to take into account to ensure a successful pain free database migration. These steps can be used for a single database, multiple databases, or an entire server. By the end of the session, you will have a checklist of the items you need to consider for a database migration.</p>

<h3>Learn History from Temporal Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.</p>

<h3>Integrating Azure ML with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI is a robust tool for building data visualizations that help businesses derive insights from their data.  Azure ML is a flexible tool that allows iterative development and deployment of predictive models across an enterprise.

It can be difficult, however, to productionize a machine learning model and present the findings to a business user in a manner that is easily-consumed and reliable.  Combining Power BI and Azure ML businesses can easily leverage predictive models and present the results in a user-friendly way.

This talk will cover the basics of Power BI and of Azure ML, how to build and deploy a model using Azure ML Studio, alternative options to Azure ML and Power BI, and demonstrate how to easily score data from an existing SQL Server DB using Power BI.</p>

<h3>Tuning Like CSS: With These Tools There's No Need Call Support</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What do you do when you have a performance or troubleshooting problem that you can’t figure out? One option is to open a support ticket with Microsoft Support (CSS). The CSS engineer will use a specific set of tools to collect and analyze workload data from your SQL Server. Based on this information they might recommend patches, configuration changes, or identify the worst-performing queries.
 
But what if you could bypass support and do all of this analysis yourself?
 
In this session, you'll learn how to use battle tested tools to analyze your workload and error logs. Armed with this information, you'll understand the root cause of the problem and propose solutions to performance and stability problems.</p>

<h3>Plan Cache performance tuning</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, we'll discuss ways to manage execution plans inside the plan cache of busy and unpredictable SQL Servers. The plan cache keeps SQL Server healthy, but all it takes is one bad execution plan to decrease server performance.

Just like gardening, keeping a database healthy requires pruning.  Techniques to manage, remove, and improve performance in the Plan Cache will be shown. The Query Store gives us power tools for this work, but it's not the entire solution.</p>

<h3>The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is no organization that is immune from performance issues with their SQL Server queries. Sometimes all it takes is one "perfect storm" that kills your server performance and lands you in the hot seat with everyone asking you what happened. While many performance issues can be addressed with an index or configuration change, what about when the root of the problem is the code itself? Whether it's a stored procedure or dynamic T-SQL generated by an ORM, the burden of proof lies with the DBA to demonstrate how the code is negatively impacting performance. 

How do you capture those bad queries? When you have this data what do you look at besides the query itself? How do you make the case to the business that a code change is necessary? In this session we will explore capturing and identifying those problem queries, the analysis of the performance data, and how to effectively communicate your findings to the business to get your proposed code change approved and implemented.</p>

<h3>Simple DR Setup</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Setting up a DR plan can be tedious.  Luckily there is a WIZARD for most of it.  However, when databases get larger, the wizards don't work as well.  Lucky for us, we have POWERSHELL!!  This presentation will show you a simple way to set up your DR plan, and if you do a lot of log shipping, say goodbye to having to manage 5 separate SQL Jobs to get one database configured.  This presentation includes usage of the community powershell tools project (dbatools.io).</p>

<h3>Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.</p>

<h3>Migration Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you've got SQL Server instances that need to be moved off of old hardware or need a version upgrade for functionality and support purposes.  Where do we begin?  What pieces do we need to consider and how are we going to get them moved?  What kind of window do we need to move everything?

We'll cover all of these things and more, as well as querying the attendees on what to do next during certain steps to ensure you have your mind in the right place.  Migrations can be tedious, but if planned properly, they can be easy and expand your knowledge for SQL Server.

**This session does not cover dbaas migrations**</p>

<h3>Discover the Hidden Mysteries of Common Table Expressions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Although they have been around since SQL Server 2005, Common Table Expressions (CTEs) have been a complete mystery to many.  As a result, there are many misunderstood myths and assumptions surrounding them. This session will explore deep into CTEs, what they are, what they are not, and how they work.  We'll look at situations where they can really help improve not only code clarity but also performance especially when compared side-by-side to usual methods.  We'll also identify situations where CTEs can be used incorrectly causing hidden performance problems.</p>
