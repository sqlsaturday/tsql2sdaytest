<h3>Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure SQL Database offers a way quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.</p>

<h3>Don't just code it—Generate It</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?</p>

<h3>Relationships Matter: Graph DB in SQL Server 2017</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Graph databases solve a lot of complex relationship challenges that relational databases struggle
to support. Relational databases are optimized for capturing data and answering
data questions.  Graph databases are highly optimized for answering questions about data relationships.  Do you, data professional, understand which data stories need which type of technology? 
- Master Data
- Networks  Infrastructure
- Trees and Hierarchies
- Connections between People 
In this session you will learn which data stories are the right fit for your relational stores, and
which are the right fit for graph databases. You will learn options for bringing this data together for more intelligent data solutions.   You will learn the basics of how this is implemented in SQL Server 2017.</p>

<h3>Applying Forensic Accounting Techniques Using SQL And R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Forensic accountants and fraud examiners use a range of techniques to uncover fraudulent journal entries and illegal activities. As data professionals, most of us will never unravel a Bernie Madoff scheme, but we can apply these same techniques in our own environments to uncover dirty data. This session will use a combination of SQL Server and R to apply these fraud detection techniques, which include Benford's Law, outlier analysis, time series analysis, and cohort analysis.</p>

<h3>Targeting Wait Statistics with Extended Events and DMVs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views new to SQL Server 2016 for examining wait statistics at a query level, rather than at the server level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.</p>

<h3>Relational Data Architecture 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.</p>

<h3>Data Hoarding (Buried Alive):  Better Data Modeling and Management When Using Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Power BI service has allowed end users and business analysts to exercise their creativity as developers.  The expansion of department resources to create elegant and visually appealing reports for themselves as well as the organization at a fast pace has taken some of the burden off developers, or has it?

Are you hoarding your environment with unorganized piles of data to feed your wonderful Power BI reports?  In this life of point and click, drag and drop reporting, we sometimes lose sight of cohesive business standards, data integration and modeling.

In this session, we will look at potential data management nightmares that include but are not limited to; overlapping data, inconsistent naming conventions, undocumented transformations, mismatch data types and varying granularity.  We will focus on the importance of having a solid data model and managing data governance using Power BI as well as traditional tools and best practices.</p>

<h3>Parameters in SQL Server - Query Performance Makers or Breakers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>T-SQL programming makes wide use of parameterization in stored procedures, dynamic statements and ad-hoc queries. Many developers aren’t aware of the significant influence they have on query performance. Incorrect use or lack of parameters is a common reason for query performance issues.
Have you experienced a query that always ran fast, suddenly (and for "no reason") become slow? And with nothing changing? Yep!
* In this session we will learn about how the plan cache deals with queries that are (and are not) parameterized. 
* You'll learn about parameter sniffing, what it is, and how it's handled in the older and newest versions of SQL. 
* We will explore the problem of mismatched data types and implicit conversions - and how that ties in with ORM generated code. 
* Lastly, we'll take a peek at value list handling from applications, and how using a table valued parameter as an input instead.
If this is a new topic to you, you'll leave this session with takeaways galore.</p>

<h3>Query Store and Automatic Tuning in SQL Server 2017 and Azure SQL DB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the most highly anticipated new features in the SQL Server 2016 release was Query Store. It's referred to as the "flight data recorder" for SQL Server because it tracks query information over time – including the text, the plan, and execution statistics. The addition of wait statistics information – tracked for each query plan – in SQL Server 2017 makes Query Store a tool that every data professional needs to know how to use, whether you're new to troubleshooting or someone who's been doing it for years. When you include the new Automatic Tuning capabilities in SQL Server 2017 and Azure SQL Database, suddenly it seems like you might spend less time fighting fires and more time enjoying a lunch break that’s not at your desk. In this session, we'll talk through these new features - and see them in action - so you can understand how you can immediately start to use them once you’ve upgraded to SQL Server 2017.</p>

<h3>Hierarchies on Steroids</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Hierarchical data sets are everywhere. If you haven't worked with one yet, you probably will someday.

If you're already working with them, you know they can be horribly complex, slow performing, difficult to maintain resource hogs that can really take the steam out of any GUI or batch process.

This simple but code intensive "Black Arts" session shows you how to quickly and easily get around all of that using all 3 common hierarchical structures and includes a very high performance method (100,000 nodes in less than 4 seconds and 1 Million nodes in less than a minute) for converting Adjacency Lists to Nested Sets that even a beginner can understand.  

If there's time, we'll cover a new "pre-aggregated" Hierarchical table structure that answers most of the questions you'd ask of a Hierarchy. You just have to know that a Tally Table is involved somewhere in this. ;-)

Don't let the "Intermediate" rating of this session scare you beginners away because we start at the ground floor.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts from an Impatient DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is about performance tuning your day. 

We spend a lot of time thinking about how to write efficient code, but we don't spend a lot of time thinking about how to be efficient with how we use our tools. In this session I will show you some lesser known keyboard shortcuts, tips, tricks, and hacks that will make your day easier. These are the tricks I've picked up over the years that help me get my work done quicker and easier.

<h3>SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.</p>

<h3>The Data-Professional’s Junk Drawer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is at least one in your home right now, a box, a basket, a bucket, perhaps even actually drawer; hastily organized at best but full of tools, gadgets, widgets and whatchamacallits designed for one or two specific purposes.  Realistically, we all want to use the more generic, multipurposed item found in our “well organized place for storing things”, yet deep down we know that tool/gadget/widget etc. is really what we need.  As data-professionals, we are all familiar with the largest “junk drawer” ever created, the Internet.  In this session, we will discuss some tools which are not data specific, the jobs they do well, and where to find them.  Join as us as explore Robocopy, parts of the SysInterals Suite, a connection manager or two, portables apps aplenty and more so that you can move that file more efficiently, troubleshoot that problem through a different lens, or simply know what the heck someone else is talking about.</p>
