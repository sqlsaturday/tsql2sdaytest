<h3>XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.</p>

Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success
Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance
Reevaluating and expanding on your solution
Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors
Choosing between alternate solutions

<h3>Inside the Black Box - Making Sense of Service Broker</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Service Broker is often seen as a black box. Messages go in, and hopefully they come out on the other side.  But when they don't, DBAs typically don’t know where to look. Trying to figure out what’s wrong quickly turns into a guessing game.
It’s not that complicated once you understand how it all works. 
Service Broker is an asynchronous messaging technology built into SQL Server that allows you to scale out your application, replicate data or perform ETL, all while guaranteeing messages are delivered and processed in the right order.   In this session, we'll discuss the basics of the Service Broker architecture, its components, and deployment options.  We will discuss troubleshooting tips and performance best practices to help you deploy a Service Broker solution in your own environment.

<h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, and SSIS packages that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way!In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.</p>

<h3>The Many Paths of Consulting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>People often dream of becoming a consultant, but what does that actually mean? Is consulting really the right path for you? Many choices are available when deciding to become a consultant, but these options can be overlooked. Contracting, consulting for an established team, going out on your own, or looking to build a larger business are all great options, depending on your vision and future goals.

This session will help you ask the right questions to better chose and prepare for your path. We then explore the various realities and strategies of each path. Real-life experiences will be shared to help you make the most informed decision on which path is best for you, and how to accelerate your career as a consultant.

<h3>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures, filled with table variables, instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cut that work from hours or days to minutes or even seconds. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. Learn:
• The most useful regular expression commands
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods</p>

<h3>Data Architecture 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.</p>

<h3>The Lost Science of Set Theory</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.</p>

<h3>Achieve More in Less Time by Using SQLPS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s face it, using SQLPS prior to SQL Server 2016 was like installing training wheels on a Ducati.   Then, some community feedback was incorporated before SQL 2016 shipped and presto, SQLPS is actually useful all of a sudden.

There is a faster way to manage and even SQL Servers using PowerShell.  I will show you what the new features in SQLPS and why you will probably find it useful, even if you aren't a "DBA".
