<h3>Real-Time Analytics with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI helps you build appealing visualizations of your data. With ever growing footprint of data it is equally important to get real-time insights into your data. It can be as simple as monitoring a single metric or viewing real-time sales performance across multiple locations. Power BI real-time streaming enables you to stream data and update dashboards in real-time. Any time sensitive data can be a source of streaming data set like IoT sensor devices, social media sources, service usage metrics etc.

In this session 
1. I will dive deep into real-time analytics with Power BI.
2. How to build streaming tiles in Power BI Dashboards.
3. Demo using Power BI REST APIs.
4. Demo using Azure Event Hub and Azure Stream Analytics.</p>

<h3>Graph Databases with Azure Cosmos DB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Graph Database technology is one of the fastest growing fields of database design and evelopment.

In SQL Server 2017 a new option to process Graph Data within the database engine was  added.
This was based around the Cypher Query language from Neo4J

At the same time a Graph Data API was added to Azure Cosmos DB (Microsoft's Globally Distributed Mult-Model cloud databse)
This was built around the Apache TinkerPop graph traversal language, Gremlin

In this Session we will briefly look at use cases for Graph Database and then investigate how these have been implemented in Azure Cosmos DB.

This session is aimed at any developer/architect/DBA that is looking to understand Graph Database and how they have been implemented inside Microsoft's new Cloud based  NoSQL database.</p>

<h3>A Database Designer's Favorite Features: Security,Privacy  More</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The launch of SQL Server 2016 means there will be a lot of blog posts and webinars of people talking about all the great administration features that come with this new release. In this session, Karen will be discussing the newer SQL Server features from a database designers point of view, including: - Dynamic Data Masking - Always Encrypted - Row Level Security - Deprecated Features - Data Type Seleciton We'll look at the new features, why you should consider them, where they work, where they don't, who needs to be involved in using them, and what changes, if any, need to be made to applications or tools that you use with SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Accelerating and modernizing data integration with Azure Data Factory</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Integration Services (aka SSIS) has been serving us for years for building enterprise data integration solutions, not only for data warehousing but for all types of data integrations between heterogenous data sources. SSIS is not retiring but it is high time to check out its new neighbor; Azure Data Factory, fully managed ETL service in the cloud. Let me show you how we can use Azure Data Factory for implementing modern data integrations for on-premise and cloud sources with various type of transformations available including Azure services such as Azure Data Lake Analytics, HDInsight and Machine Learning.</p>

<h3>Business Intelligence Solutions in Azure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When the number of services is more than 600 in Azure, many questions arise surrounding the different services that can be included in a Business Intelligence Architecture. This session will cover traditional as well as modern Business Intelligence solutions taking advantage of technologies such as Azure HDInsight, Azure Data Lakes or Azure Event Hubs. 

I will go over the characteristics of the main services that can be implemented in a Business Intelligence solution in the cloud. The demo will include 5 of these services.</p>

<h3>Want to move your data to Cloud ? what are your options?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Due to certain limitations of On-Prem Solutions, people have started to move their data to Cloud. Since Azure provide unlimited storage and processing power, most organizations have started to use Azure data related technologies in their Big Data and Analytical Solutions.  However, Azure offers different options when it comes to Big Data,Data Analytic and Data Storage.  In this session , I will cover what are the best suited options when it come to your data requirements and comparison between Azure Data related technologies.</p>

<h3>How to Maintain the Same Level of utilities in Cloud Deployments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will review the differences between deploying Microsoft SQL Server 2016 in Microsoft Azure and on-premises from a Security, Reliability and Scalability perspective.  

We'll review the common mistakes which people make when deploying SQL Server Virtual Machines to Azure which can lead to security problems including data breaches.

We'll review the common performance problems which people encounter, and how to resolve them.

We'll review the common scalability misunderstandings of Azure and SQL Server Virtual Machines.

Join us for this fun session and learn how to improve the security, reliability and scalability of your Azure deployments of SQL Server 2016.</p>

<h3>MS BI + AI experiences: Using PBI, Azure  AML across industries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Use case in presentation is from discrete manufacturing (part 2)/ higher education industries, with following summary:

1. The relative ease with which Power BI and SQL Azure can be used and integrated to design and simulate performance of machine elements

2. Power BI and SQL Azure can be used to replace “design handbooks” which typically are paper based or static on a SharePoint – now these can be made “live” by leverage Power BI and SQL Azure

3. Output from physical tests of designs can be analyzed using ML to validate relationships and can be used to predict actual performance</p>

<h3>Tune Like a Guru - The Big Three!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>EVERY client I engage with is taught to RUN 3 SCRIPTS IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT THOUGHT AND WITHOUT DELAY as soon as a performance problem is noted. I am exceptionally good at performance tuning and forensics, but I (nor anyone else out there) cannot get at the root cause of a problem without information about the occurrence. These scripts will give you said information (which is very often transient in nature)! I could be putting myself out of work teaching stuff like this! :-D</p>

<h3>Trend Analysis of SQL Server Logs using Powershell!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DBAs regularly need to keep an eye on the error logs of all their SQL Servers.When server numbers get large, it becomes very difficult to manage them. If you don't maintaining the error logs, SQL Server will recycle the log and you are going to loose the valuable information. In this session, you will learn how to automatically parse the errors from multiple SQL error logs using PowerShell, store the data in a central location database, and create reports to visualize the information using PowerBI or Splunk.</p>
