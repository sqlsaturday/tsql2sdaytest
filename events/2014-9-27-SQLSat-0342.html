<h3>Everything You Ever Knew About SSIS Is Null and Void</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release SQL Server Integration Services 2012, Microsoft did a massive overhaul to the deployment platform for SSIS. Gone is the old file based deployment system and MSDB. New to SSIS is the Integration Services Catalog. 

Along with the catalog came many new improvements, such as package and project parameters. No longer do you have to mess around with ugly configuration files, or the mess of passing data between packages. Also included are new reports which you can use to examine your packages as they run, or see the status of past runs. 

In this session we'll look at how the new project based deployment model simplifies your SSIS coding. We'll also take a dive into the catalog, uncovering the wealth of information it can provide.

<h3>Zero to Hero with PowerShell and SQL Server in 1 Session</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in the SQL Server world. Those who are using PowerShell, and those that will be. In this session you'll learn how to become one of the "cool kids" using PowerShell. 

We'll begin with a super fast paced introduction to PowerShell starting with a quick overview of the two environments you can use PowerShell in, command windows and the ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment). Next you'll learn about cmdlets, variables, functions, and logic flow. But wait, there's more! After that we'll learn how to interact with SQL Server using the SQL Provider. For the last dance we limbo, going low level with the the SQL Managment Object library, also known as SMO. 

Don't be left behind, learn how to leverage the power of PowerShell in your SQL Server environment.

<h3>Aspect Oriented Programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you heard of cross-cutting concerns? Do you fret about making the slightest change to your code-base? How does the sound of a new requirement make you feel? If you answered positively to any of the aforementioned questions, you will want to learn about AOP. AOP is a technique for localizing your cross-cutting concerns, such as transactions, security, logging and prevent them from littering what your code was originally intended to handle, namely, your business. Don't let cross-cutting concerns strangle your code base. Come learn about the PostSharp library, a library for the .NET framework that will aid you in keeping your code clear of cross-cutting concerns. </p>

<h3>What’s New in PowerShell Version 5?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With PowerShell version 4 being announced at TechEd last year and two preview versions of PowerShell version 5 already being released this year, it shows how committed Microsoft is to PowerShell and that it’s not going away any time soon which is why you can’t afford to ignore PowerShell or put off learning it any longer. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will cover the new features that are in the preview version of PowerShell version 5 to include the cmdlets in the OneGet module, the NetworkSwitch module, the PowerShellGet module and much more that you’ll have to come to this session to find out about! This session is based off of a preview version of PowerShell version 5 so everything shown is subject to change.</p>

<h3>Learn PowerShell or Die! for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Learn PowerShell or Die! That is, learn PowerShell or your career in IT will die. PowerShell is one of those technologies that as a DBA you’ll either love or hate, but believe it or not DBA’s already have the mindset for scripting since you live and work with T-SQL day in and day out. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate the different methods of retrieving information from your SQL Servers to include a way to simply wrap your existing T-SQL code inside of a PowerShell one-liner, working with SQL Server in PowerShell as if it were a file system, and creating reusable tools via functions in PowerShell that use SMO to retrieve just about any information about your SQL Servers that you could imagine.</p>

<h3>Managing Access Control with PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Access control in Windows, while very powerful, can be very complicated. Working with security descriptors one object at a time through the GUI is fairly straightforward, but that doesn’t help when you need to verify and/or configure settings for multiple objects at the same time. There are utilities available to handle this in an automated fashion, but most only work with certain types of objects, and they each have their own syntax. Fortunately, PowerShell has the ability to replace most, if not all, of those utility applications. In this session, we'll cover ways to use PowerShell to view and edit access control lists for almost any object in Windows that is secured with a security descriptor, including files, folders, registry keys, services, processes, WMI namespaces, Active Directory objects, and more. We'll cover using both native PowerShell commands, .NET methods, and the free PowerShell Access Control script module.</p>

<h3>Design and Implement BI like Edison! </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor.  In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.</p>

<h3>*** Reporting Services Support /Tips/Tricks ***</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I challenge you to bring your SSRS report issues to this session. Together we will try to find a way to solve your reporting issues. To help with solving your reporting issues, it would be great if you could bring the t-sql scripts to create the required schema and data. It would also be great to bring the report files that need to be updated. 

If you don't have any reporting issues, I'll have a few reports to show you. These reports are a lot more complex then most of the reports you need to create. Though they will demonstrate some tips and tricks.</p>

<h3>The Elephant in the Room; A DBA's Guide to Hadoop </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The term "Big Data" has risen to popularity in the last few years, and encompasses data platforms outside of the traditional RDBMS (like SQL Server).  The purpose of this session is to introduce SQL Server DBA's to Hadoop, and to promote understanding of how schema-less data can be collected and accessed in coordination with the traditional SQL models.  We'll cover the basic vocabulary of the Hadoop platform, Microsoft's integration efforts, and demonstrate how to get started with "big data".

<h3>Introducing the SSAS 2012 BI Semantic Model, aka Tabular</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>New to SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 is the BI Semantic Model, also known as the Tabular model. In this session you'll learn about the newest way to do analytics in SQL Server. We'll compare and contrast it with the traditional Multidimensional Model, then see how to create your first "cube" using the Tabular mode. Finally we'll look at some of the reporting options for using your new Tabular database, including SSRS, Excel, and PowerView. </p>

<h3>Windows Server 2012 R2 High Availability for SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the increasing adoption rate of virtualization, creating SQL Server clusters is now within reach of many more DBAs. What do you need to know about Windows Server 2012 (R2) virtualization and high availability to set up your first cluster? What's needed for geo-clustering? Come learn from a Windows Server admin and (accidental) DBA who's been building SQL Server clusters since 2000 (the year and the version!). We'll discuss initial planning, the process and the maintenance best practices. There will be demos too, so if you want to see a multi-node SQL cluster run on a Lenovo X230 tablet, come see (it's pretty cool!).</p>

<h3>Data Warehouse Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A datawarehouse environment is used differently than a transactional environment, so architecture and indexing strategies should also be different.  In this presentation, we review what the ultimate goal of an index really is, what the point of a data warehouse is, and how they relate to each other.  You will also learn common practices for indexing the different types of warehouse tables, specifically dimension tables, fact tables, and staging tables.  We will review cases when it is useful to have summary level fact tables, in addition to detail level fact tables.  Then, lastly, we will look at the benefits, and gotchas, of using columnstore indexes.</p>

<h3>Microsoft Azure SQL Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Database is part of the Microsoft Azure platform. The SQL Database component provides the relational database functionality of SQL Server, but it also provides functionality as a cloud-computing service, hosted in Microsoft data-centers around the globe. We will go over how it works and what it has to offer, as well as some of the differences and limitations.

<h3>Managing a Technical Team: Lessons Learned</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I got promoted to management a couple of years ago, and despite what I previously believed, there were no fluffy pillows and bottles of champagne awaiting me.  My team liked me, but they didn't exactly stoop and bow when I entered the room.  I've spent the last year relearning everything I thought I knew about management, and what it means to be a manager of a technical team.  This session is intended for new managers, especially if you've come from a database (or other technical) background.</p>
