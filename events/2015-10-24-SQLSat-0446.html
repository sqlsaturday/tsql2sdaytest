<h3>Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</p>

<h3>Detect Worst Performing SQL Queries During Peak Hour</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many times you have been thrown in a situation when you have been asked to fix performance issues of a database system which you have never seen before? Where do you start tuning? When do you stop tuning? Each application is different. With the ever increasing number of systems one production DBA has to manage today, it's very important to use TOP to BOTTOM approach to troubleshoot performance issues, which will lead to the answers in the right way for the application under consideration. 

While you can find top queries, wouldn't it be awesome if you can find out which ones are the exact queries taking most of the resources in last hour and current situation? Now you can focus on those specific queries!

In this session, Prakash walks you through with scenario  demos to find which exact queries are taxing production systems resources based on CPU/DISK/Memory/Network. They are all based on his own real-life experience from managing demanding database systems.</p>

<h3>S.M.A.R.T. Biml: Standardize, Model, Automate, Reuse and Transform</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to build a Data Warehouse simply by pushing a button? It might not be quite that easy yet, but gone are the days of repetitive development. Stop wasting your time on dragging, dropping, connecting, aligning and creating the same SSIS package over and over and over again and start working S.M.A.R.T. with Biml.

You already know how to build a staging environment in an hour, so let us dive straight into some advanced features of Biml. We will start by exploring the metadata modeling feature in Mist. Then we will look at how to create our own C# classes and methods, and how to centralize and reuse code. Finally, we will create a framework of transformers that allow you to modify existing objects both interactively and automatically.

If you already think Biml is powerful, just wait until you have a toolbox full of transformers ready to do the heavy lifting for you!

<h3>Optimizing desktop Power Pivot models using Power Query</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know the scene; you’ve built a beautiful Power Pivot model that has solved all of your organization’s problems.  You open it up, click Refresh and wait patiently for all the data to stream in.  That’s okay, there’s a lot of data and you expect that.  Then you click a slicer and… wait…
Time during the initial data load is one thing, but consumer’s patience during use is another.  Their tolerance for latency is much less.
In this session we’ll explore the things you can do to increase your Power Pivot model performance.  We’ll look at the key factors that affect performance, as well as the things you can do to deal with them.  In addition, we’ll look at how sourcing your data with Power Query can give you ultimate control over your data’s size and shape, and tricks to optimize it for Power Pivot consumption.</p>

<h3>Execution Plans for Mere Mortals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a beginner database professional, execution plans are intimidating. In this  session, I will take you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drill into key operators, warnings and properties.

You will understand how, why and when the execution plan will be created and saved to plan cache.

Reading the execution plan will be much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. 

After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance tuning opportunities.

Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan, save it for analysis and comparison after modifications have occurred.

<h3>Power BI is Awesome!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft has changed its Business Intelligence strategy in the last few years from an IT centric approach with SQL Server Reporting Services and SQL Server Analysis Services to an end-user ad-hoc approach with Power BI. Initially the Power BI tools were all separate add-ons to Excel 2010+ that you had to know where to get them and install/activate them individually. Now with new Power BI product announcements and Power BI Designer, the full vision of these once separate tools is becoming more clear and cohesive as an end-user ad-hoc analysis and reporting tool. In this demo heavy session you will see how Power BI is now a much more complete solution and how it can change how you deliver analysis and reporting to anyone in your company. Demos will include using Power BI Designer to pull in data from multiple sources and repeatable transformations to clean usable data and build interactive reports and dashboards.</p>

<h3>Hyper-V for SQL Server Virtualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>VMware is not the only game in town when it comes to virtualizing SQL Server in a production environment. Microsoft’s Hyper-V, which is built into Windows, is a viable and powerful option to consider when going down the path of virtualization. Microsoft currently has a few advantages over VMware, such as being able to use high speed networks and storage solutions to have blazingly fast deployments. This session will discuss Hyper-V from a SQL Server point of view based on real world deployments and architectures, providing tips and tricks along the way, and introduce you to new technologies and features you may not have heard of such as Scale Out File Server and RDMA. Whether you are a VMware shop that is looking to reduce cost by switching platforms, or just want to know how Hyper-V stacks up, this session has you covered.</p>

<h3>You did WHAT to my transaction log?!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You won't believe what people will do to the transaction log when they get into trouble. The log is full! The application is experiencing strange errors! Do something! In this session, I will apply commonly suggested advice from internet search results and various forums, in search of a fast remedy for explosive log growth. How bad could it be?!

I will illustrate with simple graphics exactly what's in the transaction log, and why it is fundamental to SQL Server's ability to ensure that the associated database is always in a consistent state. I will explain the factors that can prevent reuse of log space and how to tackle the root causes of rapid log growth, rather than simply alleviating the symptoms using dangerous quick fixes. I'll also offer tips on how to avoid excessive logging becoming a bottleneck, and affecting the performance of user transactions.

<h3>Enterprise Auditing with SQL Server Audit</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Audit. The very word strikes fear in the bravest of hearts. But as a DBA, the need to know who is doing what in your production databases is critical.  In SQL Server 2008, Microsoft finally gave us a true auditing tool. But how does it work, what exactly can it track, and how can you handle its output? 

In this session, we cover SQL Server Audit from the ground up. We go from the basics of which events can be audited to a look at how SQL Server Audit works "under the covers", and what that means for performance. While implementing server and database audits, we discuss audit granularity and filtering, as well as the pros and cons of Audit's output options.

Whether it's through the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) interface, via T-SQL, or using PowerShell and Server Management Objects (SMO), at the end of this session you'll be able to deploy SQL Server Audit across your enterprise and manage its output, fearlessly. </p>

<h3>The Reporting Machine!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dashboards and reports can be created always easier and getting better with tools such as SQL Server Reporting Services or Power View. But what do you do if you need to generate more than 600 reports? In different languages, different corporate designs, variable rendering formats and different layouts based on the data of the recipient?

In this demo based session, we will give you a complete overview into a customer project, where we used SSIS, SSRS and MDS to do exactly that.
You will see, how we:

-	import statistical data with R and SSIS
-	stuck report parts together, to get complete reports with almost 100 pages
-	define themes for different corporate designs
-	define languages for different reports
-	render the reports with different rendering extensions
-	developing Office add-ins to automate SSIS, SSRS and MDS

<h3>Designing  Building Highly Available Solutions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Building a system that is Highly Available is something that requires a lot of thought and work up-front, it is not something that is easy to add after the system is built.

In this session I will help you understand the questions you need to ask, the options that are available to you and design principals  technology that can be leveraged to build a solution that can meet your needs and the needs of your business. Covering elements from the physical storage all the way out to the client application connectivity, we will look at just what it takes to build something that can sustain component failures and keep functioning.

So no matter whether your systems are cloud resident, on-premises or hybrid we will look at how you can make sure they work as planned.</p>

<h3>Using DevOps to replace a culture of FearOps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p> DevOps is about aligning SQL Server DBAs and Development teams to utilize agile methodologies and continuous improvement to optimize application rollouts.

Hamish Watson and Martin Catherall will discuss how to break down the silos that may exist between the teams and remove “FearOps” to improve the quality and maximize the uptime of deployed applications.

 DevOps methodologies can help teams to respond faster to competitive pressures by replacing error prone (human) processes with automation for improved traceability and repeatable deployments.

Hamish has over 16 years’ experience in Enterprise Systems Management and 10 years in deploying and managing SQL Server.

He has incorporated DevOps methodologies over the past 5 years in assisting his small team of operations consultants to manage over 2,400 applications running across 400+ servers both on premise and in a hybrid cloud.

<h3>Treating Tables Like Legos, Partitioning Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you find you have tables and indexes that have grown really large? Are you moving around a lot more data than you used to? Are your windows for jobs and maintenance getting tighter? If you answered yes to any of these questions, partitioning may be for you!
Partitioning allows us to break a table or index down into smaller more manageable chunks.  Partitioning can enable us to perform maintenance on just part of a table or index. We can even move data in and out of tables with quick and easy metadata only operations. 
In this 75 minute session we’ll go over basic partitioning concepts such as horizontal vs. vertical partitioning, and techniques like partitioned views and full blown table partitioning. We’ll look at how partitioning effects things under the hood to solidify our understanding of how it works. At the end of this session you’ll have a firm understanding of partitioning and be armed with the knowledge needed to make decisions on how and when to implement partitioning.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Security Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The past few years seem to have had more than their fair share of high-profile data breaches, not all of which were caused by sophisticated hacking attempts. This session explains basic methods for securing your SQL Server by making sure you're not leaving the proverbial front door unlocked (or in some cases, wide open). We will discuss the different levels and methods that can be used for granting and restricting rights, as well as the pros and cons of each. You learn steps you can take to design databases with securability in mind from the beginning, so that you can better protect your data later. We also demonstrate scripts that can help audit user rights and make sure logins don't have any more permissions than they need. Security doesn't need to be scary! Attend this session and gain a solid foundation on which to build your DBA career.</p>

<h3>Slow Query: Bring It On</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Troubleshooting slow performance issues is hindered by lack of available repro or even at times lack of available statistics. This puts the chief troubleshooter in a Catch-22 situation. Without identifying the problem, the issue could resurface again and create another critical business problem. SQL Server 2016 introduces two new features to troubleshoot query performance issues in a reactive and proactive manner namely, Live Query Statistics and Query Data Store. 

In this session, you will learn about:
1. Using Live Query Statistics to perform live troubleshooting while it is running
2. Using Query Data Store and becoming a SQL superhero by answering questions about query performance with a click of a few buttons</p>

<h3>Life Lessons in Communication</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Communicating. We all do it, every day. But can you do it better? You present to management, share with peers, advise your direct reports. A common thread of success or failure here is how well you get your message across. 
Can you share bad news and soften the blow with humor while respecting the nature of the news you have to deliver?
Can you support your direct reports when they make a very human mistake?
Do you know how you communicate your support without micromanaging them can make a huge difference in the quality of their work for years to come? 
These questions and more will be answered, with stories, with humor, and with experience (both good and bad).
Once you've figured these things out, how do you communicate your own skills to the world? 
After attending, you’ll be on the road to better, more direct communication, whether it’s with your management, your peers, or your reports.</p>

<h3>Who Has What to Which? (The Permissions Superset)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you know who has access to your database and what permissions they have? If you answered yes, you're most likely wrong. Permissions in SQL Server don't work the way almost everyone think they do. We'll look at different scenarios you are likely to see day-to-day and explore what permissions the users are actually getting (likely not what you expect).

This exercise will demonstrate why it is important to be strict about granting permissions and cleaning up old security accounts. You will learn how to think of permissions as a superset.</p>

<h3>Dynamic SQL: Build Fast, Flexible Queries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general. Not so! 

Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. In this session, we’ll be dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrating how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.
