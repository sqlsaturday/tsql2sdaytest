<h3>Using Open Source Products to Collect Performance Metrics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why an instance is running slow or if it can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? If only you knew what performance metrics to collect and had them for your existing instances to answer these questions.

In this session, we will discuss sp_whoisactive and Query Store. Then we will be combining three open source tools – Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana – into an inexpensive system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot issues and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your Linux SQL Server instances. We will learn what metrics to collect, how to use the tools to collect performance metrics and then we’ll put it all together in an interactive dashboard for easy visualization.

Attendees will see how easy it is to get good performance data and visualize in an interactive way and combine with other tools to troubleshoot issue</p>

<h3>SQL Graph Revealed</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>‘Graph data’ is normally used to describe data that is highly interconnected. Transportation routes, social media friends or connections, organizational charts, genealogical charts, product and customer data…the scenarios where you can find them are endless. The most common way graph data is modeled in the relational world is by using many-many-relationships..querying such structures can be very painful and expensive in terms of time and computing power. There are dedicated graph databases that do this..such as Neo4j..but what if most of your data is in a relational engine already? What if you want to keep the gains of a relational engine such as security, ACID properties and high availability and still do some graph modeling? SQL Server 2016+ supports graph data modeling as well. In this talk on SQL Graph Revealed we will learn about origins of graph theory, components of graph data, and advantages of modeling relationships using graph capabilities of SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Secure SQL Server Database Design: Tactics and Technology</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When we design and build an application, do we think about security first or is it an afterthought? As we read about more and more data breaches, it is clear that we need to think security-first when designing and building our applications.

Where does design start for an application? It starts with the database layer. In this talk, we will discuss strategies for designing a more secure SQL Server database. We will start with simple design decisions for tables, views, stored procedures, and database roles that can improve security before moving on to talk about built-in SQL Server security technologies such as Always Encrypted, Row-Level Security, Dynamic Data Masking, Transparent Data Encryption, and SQL Server Audit. Lastly, we will finish up with some tips on how to retrofit security features onto existing databases and look at how data access from the application may need to change.</p>

<h3>Applying Data Warehousing Principles</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.</p>

<h3>PowerShell for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.</p>

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.</p>
