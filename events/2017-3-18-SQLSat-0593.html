<h3>Seeking the Perfect Hybrid:  On-Prem Data with Reports and Dashboards in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For many new Power BI implementations, initial self-service and team objectives are soon met, and the natural evolution of Power BI turns to an organizational focus.  In other scenarios, the enterprise seeks to preserve its investments in "classic BI" by integrating Power BI with Analysis Services and the underlying data warehouse.

In this session, Data Platform (SQL Server / BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson explores the construction of organizational BI solutions, wedding the "traditional" solutions with the reporting and analysis power of Power BI.  We'll focus upon the components of a "traditional" solution, up to the semantic model (with SQL Server Analysis Services as an example), and then explore paths to the implementation of an end-to-end enterprise solution that uses Power BI as the presentation layer.
This session applies, in most respects, to Analysis Services 2012 and above.</p>

<h3>Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the Power BI Desktop</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most of us are overwhelmed with data from all the different applications that we use on a daily basis.  Bringing all the data together is often a very time-consuming and sometimes a challenging process.  Even further, attempting to analyze and visualize the data poses new challenges that is sometime difficult or impossible to overcome.  Now with Power BI this can all be made very simple.  Individuals, ranging from novice information workers to advanced IT professionals can quickly and easily transform, analyze and visualize data using a single tool, Power BI Desktop.   In this course we will work through four main topics: Shaping Data, Building a Data Model, Visualizing Data and Using the Power BI Server.</p>

<h3>TDD with Chef, DSC and Pester</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Configuration management is currently all the rage in the DevOps space right now but few are investing in the quality of their configuration code like they do with application code.  Yet, all the same benefits apply resulting in a faster feedback loop and ultimately cost/time savings.

In this session we will cover how to develop Chef cookbooks (with DSC resources) by writing rspec/Pester tests first. We will review how the red-green-red-green process ensures we have valid and useful tests. For good measure we will also show how mocking works to help isolate your tests. In addition to simple "hello world" demos we will also demo the real-world Chef cookbooks we wrote for our custom order processing system.

Chef, Kitchen, rspec, PowerShell, DSC and Pester make for a power combination when used together to write tests which drive the development of your configuration code.  Come hear how we use this stack of tools to write our configuration code at EBSCO with high quality.</p>

<h3>Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</p>

<h3>Execution Plans for Mere Mortals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This 1-hour session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache. 

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.</p>

<h3>I like big data for $400  - Exploring quiz show questions using Angular, DocumentDB and Azure Search</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this talk, we will explore two powerful technologies from the Microsoft Azure Stack: DocumentDB and Azure Search. DocumentDB is Microsoft's NoSQL service for building globally scalable schema-free applications. Azure Search allows you to integrate the power of Microsoft's search and natural language processing abilities to explore your complex data stores. During this talk we will cover the benefits of implementing a schema-free database, we will learn how to replicate your data at a global scale with the ease of a simple configuration and we will cover various techniques of querying that data using SQL and the DocumentDB API. Once we have a large datastore in place (we will use 200k+ Jeopardy questions), we will apply the powerful natural language querying capabilities and faceted search features of Azure Search to quickly create an searchable data repository. All of this will be built and exposed using a cross-platform application built in Angular on the Electron framework.</p>

<h3>How To Be The DBA When You Don't Have A DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Not everyone has a full time Database Administrator on staff, and in many cases the responsibility of managing the database server falls on you, the developers.  But as long as the backups are running successfully you're good, right?  Not exactly.  There is ongoing maintenance required to help ensure that your databases are running smoothly.  Are your statistics out of date?  Are your indexes fragmented?  When was the last time the databases were checked for corruption? Has your SQL Server been tuned to fit your workload, or are you still running with the less optimal default settings?

Tailored to the "Non-DBA", this session will cover these topics and more to ensure that you can avoid some performance issues you may not even realize you're having.  Discussing server settings, database configurations, and recommended maintenance, you will leave this session with the knowledge (and scripts!) you need to help ensure that your SQL Server and databases are in top shape.</p>

<h3>PowerShell Non-Monolithic Script Module Design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Creating a script module in PowerShell is a very simplistic process, but there are a number of reasons why you might not want to create one huge monolithic PSM1 script module file that contains all of your module’s functions. During this session, Microsoft MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate how to separate each of your module’s functions into its own dedicated PS1 file that’s dot-sourced from your script module’s PSM1 file along with discussing this design methodology and the challenges that it creates. Many times resolving one problem seems to create more problems such as cmdlets from other modules showing up as being exported by your module. The solution to these problems and more will be provided during this session. Mike will also demonstrate using a Pester test to validate that all of the functions are indeed exported along with using a function to help automate the module manifest update process when additional functions are added to your module.</p>

<h3>Rapid On-Demand Creation of Dev/Test Databases with SQL Clone</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Imagine a world where developers and testers could run production-like environments on their own workstations, created on-demand and self-serviced. Raising tickets and waiting hours or days to get operations to deliver test databases would be a thing of the past. 

With Redgate's new tool, SQL Clone, this world now exists. Administrators and developers can create their own database copies in SECONDS using just MEGABYTES of disk space without ever touching production. Developers can see how their application behaves in a production-scale environment during both development and troubleshooting and operations no longer needs to be involved to find disk space, provision, etc. You can quickly make a series of "throw-away" copies of a database to run a variety of scenarios against without going through the usual full backup/restore cycle repeatedly.

In this session we will examine how SQL Clone uses disk virtualization to enable quick, easy and even automated creation of database copies</p>

<h3>Operationalizing Digital and Enterprise Data in Hybrid Azure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many companies match, merge, and enrich their customer data on premises in the enterprise, but their most valuable marketing systems operate and leverage customer data off premises in the digital realm. Moreover, digital data tends to manifest itself in an semi-structured (clickstream) and unstructured (images) format while enterprise data still tends to be structured. How do you combine customer behavior and attributes to drive marketing in a world such as this? Because this is only a 60 minute session, I am going to layout and demo an architecture as well as discuss production implications in terms of IT and the Business.</p>

<h3>Vote or Die: Which is Faster?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wondered what's faster between a bulk insert and BCP?  What about index seek vs index scan?  This session will review multiple topics of SQL Server that include development, ETL, and administration.  In the spirit of our recent election, this session will feature having the ability to debate and vote on which of each technology you think we will be best, and if your "candidate" wins, your votes will be entered into a drawing; so the more votes you win the more chances you get!</p>

<h3>Welcome To the 2016 Query Store!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of my favorite new features in SQL Server 2016 is the Query Store. The Query Store houses valuable information on performance of your queries as well as gives you great insights into your query workload. This presentation will take a look at the Query Store, how it works and the type information it holds and how you can use it to analyze performance issues.  New DMVs will be introduced and the performance impact of enabling the Query Store will be discussed. Both DBAs and developers can increase their performance tuning skills by attending this session.</p>

<h3>Learning R And Talking About Football</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R -- it's included in SQL Server 2016. What can I do with it? Why do I need to know yet another software language? How can I use it to figure out important things -- like who is the best qb in the league right now, statistically?

We'll go over the basics of R and how to do things with it, plus items such as:

- Installing and managing packages
- Accessing data in various formats
- Basic data visualization functions</p>
