<h3>Building a Big Data Solution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a follow-on to the presentation “Building an Effective Data Warehouse Architecture”, this vendor-free presentation will explain exactly what Big Data is and its benefits, including use cases.  We will discuss how Hadoop, the cloud and massively parallel processing (MPP) is changing the way data warehouses are being built.  We will talk about hybrid architectures that combine on-premise data with data in the cloud as well as relational data and non-relational (unstructured) data.  We will look at the benefits of MPP over SMP and how to integrate data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  You will learn what a modern data warehouse should look like and how the role of a Data Lake and Hadoop fit in.  The Big Data boom brings new challenges to those of you who define the architectures to create and consume business-critical data.  You will need guidance on the best solution for your data warehouse going forward.  This presentation will help to give you that guidance! </p>

<h3>SQL Server Reporting Services 2014 on Steroids!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.

<h3>Self-Service ETL with Power Query</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Before any significant data analysis can take place the data often needs to be transformed, aggregated, and combined. This is often referred to as the ETL (Extraction, Transfer, and Load) process. Power Query is an excellent tool in the Microsoft self-service BI stack that allows business users to discover, combine, and refine data before loading it into a Power Pivot model for further analysis. In addition Microsoft has made connecting to a wide variety of sources including relational, structured, and semi structured data a consistent intuitive experience. This session guides you through using Power Query to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a Power Pivot model. In addition we will look at the M language created by the tool and look at some advanced queries you can create using M.</p>

<h3>SSIS 2012/2014:  The Quiet Revolution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server 2012 release of SSIS was a complete game changer.  Using sample packages, we'll show you how to deploy projects to the new SSIS catalog.  You will see how project level parameters and connection managers can make your life easier. You will learn how to configure packages using the new configuration editor in SSMS. We'll show you how to define a collection of configuration settings called an Environment which can automatically configure packages deployed to a server.  Find out why SQL Agent no longer captures SSIS errors in the log and how you can get information about failed packages.  Get up to speed on using the latest features of SSIS to make you job easier.  </p>

<h3>Leadership Without Borders: Working with Global Teams</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As companies become more global, IT teams need to adapt. This often means having resources in locations outside our home countries as well as hiring outside parties for staff augmentation. As we place people in locations outside our own walls, processes and practices need to keep up with this shift. 

Whether your people are in Boston, Berlin, Bangalore, or Beijing, they all need to work together. We look at the challenges of having a globally diverse team, including collaboration, feedback, work assignments, and performance evaluations. We also look at outsourcing, offshoring, and a combination of the two. And we look at one of the greatest benefits: follow-the-sun support. 

In this session, we demonstrate how a language barrier isn't usually the biggest challenge and how cultural differences make the most impact. </p>

<h3>Handling Data Error in a Data Flow</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It can be frustrating to build an SSIS package with a data flow task and have data related errors where you can't identify the row or column that caused the error because of the cryptic or generic error messages presented to you by SSIS and the driver.  How do you find out what caused error?  Is there a way to get a better error message?  Can I identify the rows?  We'll go over a method I developed to handle error rows  using a script task (at one time upgraded to a custom component) so the offending data can be identified and corrected.  We will discuss ways to correct the problems in an automated fashion.  We will discuss other options in addition to my solution.  

Prerequisites:

Experience developing SSIS packages
T-SQL Experience
Basic .NET knowledge</p>

<h3>Introduction to Biml</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.</p>

<h3>Azure SQL Data Warehouse Overview</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft recently announced the SQL Data Warehouse Platform as a Service (PaaS) feature for Microsoft Azure.  This platform provides an on-demand Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) platform for build data warehouses that can handle from 10s of TBs of data up to PBs. This session will provide an overview of SQL Data Warehouse with a discussion on the value that Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) brings to your data warehouse and why the cloud may be the best platform for your solution.  In this session, we’ll also dig into the capabilities of SQL Data Warehouse and compare those to other offerings.
•             Scale from terabytes to petabytes
•             Save on costs through on-demand scale
•             Take advantage of architecture designed for scalable performance
•             Gain a cloud integrated data warehouse solution</p>

<h3>100 Times Faster: Experiences making SQL Server go fast</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do you go about making a program run a lot faster!  Like 100 times faster?   It’s difficult.  Microsoft tried in the Hekaton project, its in-memory tables feature of SQL 2014, and they got close.  Inspired by that effort, this presentation looks at some recent cases where I’ve been able to achieve huge performance improvements in SQL Server code and how that happens.

When I work on SQL Server performance I emphasize that the first thing to think about is how to accomplish the task in a different way that will be much faster”.   Sometimes there’s a better algorithm.  Sometimes a different technology is more appropriate.  Sometimes it’s a combination of many changes that combine to create the desired outcome much, much faster. 

This presentation is illustrated with examples from my work and we'll look for common threads that might help us all.</p>

<h3>Unleashing SSIS with expressions, configurable properties, and parameters</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p> Have you struggled to build SSIS packages?  You are starting to get the hang of it, but many things more than basic data movement remain a frustrating challenge.  The SSIS expression language is an incredible source of power within SSIS but a profound challenge to many.  Another area of power and flexibility in SSIS is its very broadly scoped configurability.  This presentation will walk through the basics of the SSIS expression language including the whys and wherefores of a few expression peculiarities.  Then we will review how you can use those expressions to configure so many of the properties in SSIS that you might barely recognize what your package can do when you are finished.  Finally we will review input parameters and how to further influence the behavior of your packages at run time.  Download includes slide deck, expression samples, and some packages.</p>

<h3>You Can Still Analyze Data with T-SQL ... No Really</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will look at a variety of T-SQL functions and techniques that can be used to analyze data. Including demos of CUBE, ROLLUP and the various "window" functions which use the OVER function. These are not the new functions, but they are often underused. With in-memory OLTP on the horizon, relational queries will perform even better. This is the time to brush up on or learn about analyzing data with T-SQL.</p>
