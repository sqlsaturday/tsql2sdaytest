<h3>Pivoting Performance Data  Pinpointing Problems</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever been wrought with end user complaints of database performance issues only to open your tools that show only live performance or limited historical performance and find no answers? After being bit by this many times, I developed my own eye in the sky to monitor CPU  Physical IO at the database, user and application levels. This solution logs data continuously and parses it into an Analysis Services cube which can be queried by Excel. No need to requisition funds for 3rd party tools. You can do this with the tools you have and I’ll give you the scripts to get started. Using these tools I have been able to find needles in haystacks and effectively communicate the nature of the problems to people at all levels.

<h3>Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.</p>

<h3>Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.</p>

<h3>Possible Musics:  SSAS Multidimensional vs Tabular</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI. BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server. Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with SSAS 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths. In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features. He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX:  The (Very) Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.</p>

<h3>"What is the Best Disaster Recovery Solution?"</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It depends, every situation is different. The question is often asked of DBA's to provide a solution to very open ended requirements.  However, the best solution can only be provided if the database professional is getting all the answers.  This session is a case study into many of Disaster Recovery options that we as database professionals have.  Understand the answers to the important questions that  we should be asking to provide the best solution not only for the database but for the business as well.  As an attendee you will learn how to change an answer from it depends into a solid solution that can be built upon. We will take examples from experiences and as a group determine what the best solution is. </p>

<h3>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.
