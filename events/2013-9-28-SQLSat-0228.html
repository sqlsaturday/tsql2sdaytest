<h3>Rapid Data Integration using SharePoint Business Connectivity Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Anthony Obi – Performing CRUD operations against SQL data sources using SharePoint Business Connectivity Services.Many organizations see SharePoint as yet another silo of information that can only access data stored in its Lists and Libraries. In this session, Anthony will review working with external SQL data from within SharePoint using Business Connectivity Services (BCS). He will cover the basic fundamentals required to perform ‘CRUD’ (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations against external SQL Databases, whilst also exploring a variety of SharePoint features available through a series of real time demonstrations. Finally, Anthony will attempt to highlight key points/comparisons to look out for when attempting to use in real world scenarios.</p>

<h3>From Big Data to secret sauce: power your organisation with PowerBI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Big Data is not so much about storing massive amounts of data in a common database. It is also a force of change for the organisation, and it means that we have to consider the collective capabilities of the platform to serve the business: from data source to secret sauce that will help the business to make data-driven decisions to drive the enterprise forward, using familiar tools such as the new Microsoft Power BI tools
 
In this session, we will look at RHadoop, which is a match made in heaven for data scientists. It is a combination of R, the world's favourite free data analysis tool, and Hadoop. In this session, we will look at an example of using RHadoop to analyse Big Data, from data to result.
 
We will also look at evangelising your secret sauce throughout the business, using Microsoft’s new Power BI tools in Office 365: Power View, Power Map and Power Query. Come and see how to make Big Data accessible, relevant and perhaps even fun!</p>

<h3>The Irish Economic Crisis, Visualized</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will explore the Irish Economic Crisis as it unfolded, using Microsoft’s latest Visualisation tools including Power BI, Power Query, Power Map, Power View and SharePoint”.   It starts from a very common business perspective, needing to make sense of data, fast, but not knowing what questions to ask, nor how to combine available sources in a way that makes sense.   This session converts the Irish Economic crisis into a story that can be explored in an interactive way, using familiar tools, in a way that people may feel should have been noticed in the run-up to the crisis.</p>

<h3>Leveraging PowerShell for SharePoint Database Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowerShell has become the lifeblood of SharePoint Administrators and it's simplicity, elegance and intuitive nature makes our lives easier, or does it?

Many SharePoint admins suffer from "decisions made by SharePoint" when using both the UI and PowerShell to configure and manage their farms, database operations in particular are often clunky and inefficient due to how SharePoint uses its own stored procedures to manage its databases.

In this session we will look at how SharePoint admins can unleash their DBA-fu via PowerShell to help their SharePoint farm databases run efficiently, optimally and (the big one) FASTER.

If you want to understand how you can utilise PowerShell in SharePoint database scenarios, this session is for you.</p>

<h3>Automating Database Restores and Verification with PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server makes it simple to automate backups with jobs and maintenance, but doesn't provide a simple method to schedule test restores to prove the backups have worked. Using PowerShell we can write simple scripts that allow us to automate test restores from our SQL backups, and then check that the restored database is valid, consistent and usable. 

This session will introduce you to the basics of restoring simple databases with PowerShell scripts, and then extending this to cope with more complex situations including data file relocation, point in time restores and running DBCC checks against the restored database

<h3>Getting the most from your SAN - File and Filegroup design patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve been given the task of optimising the File and Filegroup layout to get the most from your storage. Not sure where to start, or thinking you could get a more from your storage with a different design?

Are your SAN guys telling you your storage can process 2 GB/s but you're only seeing 200 MB/s?

This session will dive into how to optimise your File and Filegroup layout strategy to get the most from your I/O Subsytem, including a case study where we took a customer's table scans from 500 MB/s to 1.2 GB/s with only a change in filegroup layout.

Topics covered include:
- Layout for OLTP
- Data Warehousing Fast Track Style
- Data Warehousing on a SAN
- Get data into your SSAS cubes faster (ProcessData)

<h3>Advanced Indexing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!
Hugo will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries. Then, you will see the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes. And finally, you will get an stunning demonstration of just how bad you can hurt performance by following all those recommendations and creating too many indexes.</p>

<h3>Hadoop for the Microsoft Guy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft have released a distribution of Hadoop targeted at making big data accessible to everyone.  Hadoop is different to SQL Server.  Not necessarily better, just different.  It is a tool for a job.  if you have only ever worked with an RDBMS such as SQL Server then Hadoop is going to play with your mind a little and you are going to need to rethink a few things.
This session is going to take Hadoop and break it apart.  I will also look at some of the tooling Hive and Pig.
Keep an open mind and let me show you that Hadoop has lots to offer.

<h3>Create Your Own Data Type</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever needed a data type that SQL Server simply does not support? So why not add it?
Ever since SQL Server 2005, you can easily create additional data types for use in SQL Server. Using .NET integration, you can define a data type and program all the methods you need to make it behave exactly the way you want it to - both in the database and in your .NET application programs.
This session will show you exactly how to create a CLR user-defined data type, and how to integrate it in your database. Will you be the one who creates the next Big Thing, the data type that puts Spatial and Hierarchyid to shame?</p>

<h3>SQL anti patterns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.</p>

<h3>SharePoint HA and DR</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When it comes to SharePoint High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) are often merged and confused. In this session we'll take a look at the various HA tools that are available to you  when configuring a SharePoint Farm. We'll look at this from a SQL perspective and from a SharePoint perspective and consider what the implications are when applying patches and deploying customisations to a SharePoint Farm for HA and DR. We'll consider some HA and DR scenarios for SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013 and take a look at the use of SQL Always On as it relates to SharePoint.</p>
