<h3>SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.</p>

<h3>Create Stunning Visualizations with The Help of R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>R is the first choice for data scientists for a good reason: besides accessing and transforming data and applying statistical methods and models to it, it has a wide variety of possibilities to visualize data. As visual perception of data is the key to understanding data, this capability is crucial. This session will give you a broad overview over available packages and diagram types you can build with them on the one hand, and a deep dive into common visualizations and their possibilities on the other hand. Impress yourself and your peers with stunning visualizations which will give you insights into data you could not achieve with other tools of Microsoft’s BI stack.</p>

<h3>What are Azure SQL Database Managed Instances?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The range of options for storing data in Microsoft Azure keeps growing, the most notable recent addition is the Managed Instance. But what is it, and why is it there? Join John as he walks through what they are and how you might start using them.

Managed Instances add a new option for running workloads in the cloud. Allowing near parity with a traditional on-premises SQL Server. Including SQL Agent, Cross Database Queries, Service Broker, CDC, and many more. Overcoming many of the challenges to using Azure SQL Databases.

But, what is the reality, how do we make use of it, and are there any gotcha’s that we need to be aware of? This is what we will cover, going beyond the hype and looking at how we can make use of this new technology.</p>

<h3>Disaster Recovery and High Availability in Azure SQL Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>While Azure SQL Database does have built-in safety mechanisms, these are not always well understood. Further, a good architect will ensure redundancy even with an already protected system. This session will show how Azure SQL Database is built and maintained by Microsoft to provide protection for your production information. We’ll also go over methods you can employ to add additional protection to your systems. Moving to the cloud and taking advantage of all that it offers doesn’t mean your data is automatically, fully protected. The knowledge from this session will help to ensure a higher degree of safety, faster recovery, and more up-time for your Azure SQL Databases.</p>

<h3>Python Machine Learning: Would you survive?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Curious about machine learning? 
We will help you get started with machine learning in Python. Python is a powerful open-source programming language that is easy to get started with. 
It is increasingly incorporated into software, such as Azure Machine Learning. 

This session introduces machine learning in Python as well as an overall introduction to the Scikit-learn library. 
Scikit-learn is a library designed to provide access to well-known machine learning algorithms. The library is open source, developed by hundreds of contributors from around the world and used across industry and academia. 

We will show how we use data about the passengers on the Titanic to find out what characterizes the survivors.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Warehouse: Why, What and How</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If your regular SQL Server becomes too slow for running your data warehouse queries, or uploading the new data takes too long, you might benefit from the Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Via its “divide and conquer” approach it provides significant performance improvements, yet most client applications can connect to it as if it is a regular SQL Server.
But to benefit from these performance improvements we need to implement our Azure SQL Data Warehouse in the right way. In this session - through a lot of demos - you will learn how to setup your Azure SQL Data Warehouse, review indexing in the context of the Azure SQL Data Warehouse and see that monitoring is done slightly different from what you’re used to.</p>

<h3>That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From the Inside</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has a number of metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks, and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from the smallest column up through an entire SQL Server instance and everything in-between. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We'll also demonstrate the new SQL Data Discovery/Classification and Vulnerability Assessment features in SQL Server Management Studio.</p>

<h3>Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Technology changes quickly - patterns and approaches less so. As people move towards the cloud, there are clear benefits of adopting a polyglot cloud architecture employing a range of distributed components.

This session will take you through the pattern known as the Lambda architecture, a reference pattern for building data analytics systems that can handle any combination of data velocity, variety and volume. The session will outline the set of tools and integration points that can underpin the approach. Do you design real-time reporting systems? Or crunch petabytes of data? Perhaps you are adopting a cloud architecture and just want to handle anything the future throws at you? This session is for you.

We will follow the movement of data through batch and speed layers via Azure Data Lake Store  Analytics and Streaming Analytics before considering the serving layer with Azure SQL DataWarehouse and downstream reporting tools.</p>

<h3>Biml for Beginners: Script and Automate SSIS Development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you tired of creating and updating the same SSIS packages over and over and over again? Is your wrist hurting from all that clicking, dragging, dropping, connecting and aligning? Do you want to take the next step and start automating your SSIS development?

Say goodbye to repetitive work and hello to Biml, the markup language for Business Intelligence projects.

In this session, we will first look at the basics of Biml and how to automatically generate SSIS packages from database metadata. Then we will explore techniques for reusing code and implementing changes across projects with just a few clicks. Finally, we will create an example project that you can download and start with to generate all the SQL scripts and SSIS packages needed to build a staging environment in just a few minutes.

Stop wasting your valuable time on doing the same things over and over and over again, and see how you can complete in a day what once took more than a week!</p>

<h3>Start testing your SSIS packages with ssisUnit</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do you test your SSIS packages? Do you prepare them, set the parameters and variables, maybe get some sample or production data and run few times by hand in SSDT? It’s not a bad practice when you start your ETL journey, but after some time you probably think about automation. If not – you should. Perhaps you have some SQL scripts that verify data in the tables after package execution, but if you are like me, somewhere inside you feel that it’s not enough. It’s time you start automated SSIS unit and integration testing.

On this session, I will show you why you should and how to start with automated testing of the packages and the whole projects using ssisUnit – the free SSIS testing library. I will start with some basics and move forward to the real-life examples of the unit and integration testing of the SSIS packages/ projects/solutions. You will see the benefits of automated testing and that testing is hard only at the beginning.</p>

<h3>How mature has SSAS Tabular mode become?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SSAS Tabular mode is available sind version 2012. And for a lot of people, especially experienced SSAS Multidimensional users, the first versions left a lot to ask for. 
But Tabular experienced a lot of remarkable changes up to now. Let's look at a short summary of this interesting life story. And let's try to identify the most important steps of development. 
Another interesting view point is the comparison to SSAS Multidimensional mode. Which features are provided by both versions, where are the competitive advantages? 
This session will cover a more strategic point of view to both worlds with only short demos. And a common understanding of the important features of analytical solutions will be expected.</p>

<h3>Developing Graph structures with the CosmosDB Gremlin API</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Analysing highly connected data using SQL is hard! Relational databases were simply not designed  to handle this,  but graph databases were.  Built from the ground up to understand highly connected data, graph databases enable a flexible performant way to interrogate and traverse highly connected data. 

If you have looked at graph processing in SQL Server then you will know it has limitations. Well Microsoft developer has a few alternatives, one of those being the Gremlin API in CosmosDB. In this session, we seek to explore, what is a graph database, why you should be interested, what query patterns does they solve and how to use Gremiln's fantastic language.</p>

<h3>Deep dive into Adaptive Query Processing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Until SQL Server 2016, the Query Optimizer and the Execution Engine were strictly separated. The Query Optimizer produces an execution plan that, based on statistics and estimates, should be fast. That execution plan is then faithfully executed by the Execution Engine, even if reality turns out to be different from expectations.

SQL Server 2017 changes this! Three new features now allow execution plans to adapt to reality. Memory Grant Feedback increases or decreases assigned memory based on past experience. The Adaptive Join operator allows the optimizer to create two alternative plans, the best of which will be decided at execution time. And with Interleaved Execution, parts of the plan are even completely recompiled mid-execution, with much better cardinality estimates.

If you are more interested in how all this ACTUALLY works than in shiny marketing slides, come to this session. We will spend the full 60 minutes knee-deep in execution plan internals!</p>

<h3>Azure database perfomance by dbWatch AS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The popular image of cloud services is both attractive and enticing. You get access to an unlimited amount of hardware at a reasonable price. Your systems can run seamlessly and at peak performance anywhere in the world, and It is natural to assume that the performance of cloud services is identical and stable, regardless of whether it’s located in Asia, Europe or North America
To confirm if this is really the case or not, we conducted two tests periods in Azure. One in December 2016 and one in March 2018. Three Service tiers were tested: Basic 5 DTU, Standard S3 100 DTU and Premium P2 250 DTU. The tests have been done at three locations: West Europe, West Japan and West US.

We will present the test methods and harness uses, and the results and findings.

Based on our measurements we have seen:
- Significant variations in performance between the different geographical locations
- Significant variations in performance for the same database at different times
- Surprisingly poor</p>

<h3>Getting To Know SQL Server Encryption Capabilities</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With stricter EU privacy laws like GDPR, the need to encrypt data is greater than ever.
In this session we'll look at what SQL Server offers in this area:
1) symmetric and asymmetric server encryption which lets the server encrypt table data and control the keys, 
2) Always Encrypted (AE) which works similarly to server encryption but the client control the keys meaning server can't decrypt the data
3) Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) which encrypts your data at rest making getting data from stolen drives useless
4) creating secure SSL/TLS communication channels between your apps and the server to prevent clear text network traffic which can be observed</p>

<h3>Database Internals meets PowerBI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Understanding and investigating the Internals of an SQL Server database requires use of advanced (often undocumented) DMV's or DBCC commands 

While these provide an insight into the low-level data structures of the database it can be difficult to visualise how these are actually implemented inside the mdf files of the database.

In this session we will see how adding the visualisation options of PowerBI and the Power of R can be used to get a better understanding of how SQL internally manages your data.

Rather than just talking about Fragmentation, Page Splits or Forwarded records, in this session we will show how these physically appear.</p>

<h3>Bringing DevOps to the Database</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is a hot topic in today’s software development world. However most of the knowledge and experience with DevOps is based around application software and ignores the database.
