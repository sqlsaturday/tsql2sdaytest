<h3>Data Science for beginners</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data science can be hard to grasp, complex and big, but making data science easy to understand and bringing it closer to all who want to tackle this new emerging field is an important task in world of data.  Exploring, extracting and finding hidden gems  from data using statistical and mathematical methods, computer science and several different technologies is essentially what data science is doing. In practice this means, data science is an iterative process of harvesting data, managing and cleaning the data,  performing analysis and and at the end interpreting, visualizing and using information  that will bring insights to end-user, business people and making decisions much easier.
We will focus on answering 5 simple questions. 

1) is this weird? 
2) is A better than B, respectively? 
3) how much / many of this is needed? 
4) this belong to group A? 
5) what is next?

Session we will look into technologies that can be tackled using SQL Server 2016 and ML Azure.</p>

<h3>Analyzing Text with SQL Server, R, and Azure ML</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Text mining is becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media. Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions. Semantic Search, a new component in Full-Text Search, can help you understanding the meaning of documents. The Term Extraction and Term Lookup components from SQL Server Integration Services also help with text analysis. Free statistical package / language R is also useful for the text mining tasks. Azure ML is adding additional techniques to the big picture. However, the question arises: is all this enough? This presentation unveils the good and the bad side of text mining with the tools mentioned.</p>

<h3>Data Quality Services: Let's clean our data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data quality and data consistency today are big concerns for people working with databases. 
Data Quality Services (DQS) is a feature introduced in SQL Server 2012, that aims to give users and IT professionals a simple and flexible solution to these problems.
It allows to perform cleansing operation on bad data such as: correction, standardization, completion and de-duplication. 

In this session we'll introduce the main concepts of DQS, and its components. We'll see how to create and build a Knowledge Base, how to implement a Data Quality Project, how to define and manage a Domain.
Starting from real world example, we'll learn how to perform Data Cleansing and Matching and how to define business rules to verify and mantain data integrity.

For those who are working with SQL Server versions prior to 2012,  we'll show some tasks and techniques to implement data quality, exploiting other SQL Server's suite tools, although DQS is not yet available.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Infernals: Worst Practices in Action</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let’s face it: Best Practices are too many to really know them all and choose which ones should be applied first. Does your telephone ring all the time? Do your users ask for that “quick report” that instead takes ages and keeps changing every time you think it’s done? 

Have you ever thought that in dire times avoiding Worst Practices could be a good starting point and you can leave fine tuning for a better future? If the answer is “yes”, then this session is for you: we will discover together how not to torture a SQL Server instance and we will see how to avoid making choices that in the long run could turn out to be not as smart as they looked initially.</p>

<h3>Columnstore Indexes: what they are, and how to use them</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>La prima apparizione dei ColumnStore Indexes risale a SQL Server 2012 e, nel corso degli anni, l'aggiunta di numerose funzionalità quali indici aggiornabili e continuo incremento delle performance li hanno resi una scelta appetibile in ambito Enterprise sia per carichi di lavoro DWH che OLTP.
Il recente Service Pack 1 di SQL Server 2016, inoltre, estende l'adozione dei CI con le dovute limitazioni in termini di risorse a tutte le edizioni, Express compresa.
In questa sessione verranno introdotti i Columnstore Indexes, concentrandosi sulle differenze rispetto ai tradizionali B-Tree, su come utilizzarli al meglio e sulle attenzioni da prestare nel passaggio tra le varie versioni ed edizioni di SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Performance tips for faster SQL queries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When you need to extract data from the database you are writing, more or less complex, T-SQL code. Often simplistic and procedural approach reflects what you have in your mind, however this could have a negatively impact about performance because the database engine might think otherwise. Fortunately T-SQL, as a declarative language, allows us to ask the "what" and delegate to the engine the "how". Everything works best as long as you respect a few simple rules and you may use special constructs. In this session, with few slides and a lot of real-case scenarios, you can see the advantages of writing the query for high performance, even when they are written by that "someone else" called ORM.</p>

<h3>Performance Tuning for the Transaction Log</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server transaction log is one of the most critical components of the database and in the same time one of the most misunderstood. While being neglected it can easily become a bottleneck for our system. Are you interested in learning how to avoid issues with the transaction log and streamline its work? In these sessions we will explore how to optimize it, configure it and keep it under control.</p>

<h3>Indici e statistiche: quanto e come incidono sull'efficenza dei nostri databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Un modello dei dati relazionale si avvale di indici di varia natura per elevare il grado di efficienza delle queries. Ma lo strumento che l'Engine utilizza per individuare se e quali indici possano soddisfare al meglio una query è l'insieme delle statistiche allestite sulle tabelle e sugli indici. Questa sessione prova ad illustrare il legame tra le due entità e il modo in cui l'ottimizzatore può trarre vantaggio o essere "ingannato".</p>

<h3>SQL Server deployment journey, da Dev a Ops</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Anche il mondo dei database relazionali risente della cultura DevOps. Sarebbe strano il contrario, possiamo fare unit test, possiamo metterlo in scenari di continuous integration, possiamo automatizzare i processi sfruttando sia piattaforme as a service che on premises. In questa sessione proveremo ad implementare una soluzione completa, con tanto di deploy su diversi ambienti, fino alla produzione, il tutto seguendo pratiche DevOps ed utilizzando VSTS ed i suoi plugin. Un walkthrough verso il delivery automatizzato.</p>

<h3>Exploring SQL Server Plan Cache</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In questa sessione esploreremo la Plan Cache, la zona in cui SQL Server memorizza i piani di esecuzione. Si parlerà di come viene gestita e delle tecniche che permettono di scoprire quali sono i piani di esecuzione in cache, da quanto tempo risiedono lì, quante volte sono stati utilizzati e se contengono operatori sub-ottimali come scansioni, operazioni di ordinamento eseguite nel tempdb e altri tipi di warning. Sapere quello che è successo permetterà di sapere cosa è necessario ottimizzare.</p>

</h3>
<p>Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…</p>
