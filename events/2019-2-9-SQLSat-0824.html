<h3>Analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?</p>

<h3>5 ways to track Database Schema changes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the perfect world, only Database Administrators have access to SQL Server databases. All database schema changes go through strict Change Management Process where they need to be well described and approved by Change Advisory Board. The database schema is stored in a source code repository and deployed version doesn't drift unexpectedly from its original model.

Unfortunately, we don't live in the perfect world.

Sometimes database schema is changed without our knowledge and supervision. Sooner or later such unexpected schema changes start to be very problematic. They may break some functionality or create some performance issues.

In such a case, various questions arise and you as a DBA will have to answer them.
•	What has been changed?
•	When it has been changed?
•	By who it has been changed?

In this session, I will demonstrate you 5 different ways to track database schema changes. Thanks to this, you always will be able to easily answer such questions.</p>

<h3>Cut the tables into partitions v.2</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In February 2018. at the meeting of the Warsaw Data Comunnity group, I was talking about partitioning. Due to the great interest, I decided to repeat this session but in a slightly changed form. During this session, one of the techniques of database optimization will be presented which is the partitioning of tables and indexes of the SQL Server database. This allows you to improve performance, understood as the speed of access to data and facilitates management. Partitioning is related to various mechanisms such as partition switching, partition sliding window or partition elimination, which can be helpful in everyday work. Basic terms, methods of partitioning, advantages and disadvantages of good practices will be discussed. I will mention the myths of partitioning. Everything will be supported by examples.</p>

<h3>Power-up your BI project with PowerApps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The world is not perfect as well as any IT project is. In Business Intelligence, as an example, it's almost impossible to avoid some flat files and/or user input. Usually you will repeat and do some stuff manually on your own or you will create an Excel or flat file upload interface. But maybe there is a better way... What do you say about giving to the users the web application that looks nice, automate the boring stuff for you and send the data to your data warehouse and also doesn't require a lot of development? This can be done with PowerApps and maybe Microsoft Flow. During the session I will first of all introduce PowerApps and Microsoft Flow, and also will share with some experience from previous usage. I will show you how easy it is to create the application, but also I will tell you what sucks and what do you need to keep in mind if you really want to use these two technologies in real world.</p>

<h3>Testuj swoje pakiety SSIS z ssisUnit [PL/EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do you test your SSIS packages? Do you prepare them, set the parameters and variables, maybe get some sample or production data and run a few times by hand in SSDT? It’s not a bad practice when you start your ETL journey, but after some time you probably think about automation. If not – you should. Perhaps you have some SQL scripts that verify data in the tables after package execution, but if you are like me, somewhere inside you feel that it’s not enough. It’s time you start automated SSIS unit and integration testing.

On this session, I will show you how to start with automated testing of the packages and the whole projects using ssisUnit – the free SSIS testing library. I will start with some basics and move forward to the real-life examples of the unit and integration testing of the SSIS packages/ projects/solutions. You will see the benefits of automated testing and that testing is hard only at the beginning.</p>

<h3>Continuous Delivery for BI projects [EN]</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you are releasing new reports, SSAS cubes or SSIS packages on a regular basis, you've probably offered up your share of blood, toil, tears and sweat on getting them delivered into production in working condition.
Continuous Delivery is a way to bridge the gap between developers and IT professionals and for that we need to address the both the toolchain to support the practices as well as the mindset on the team. Microsoft offers a set of tools that'll help you on your journey towards the end goal: Maximize predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of operational processes.

We will in detail be looking at:

Agile Development Frame of Mind
        The Path Ahead (direction)
	Visual Studio Online (tool)
	Feature/User Story/Work Item (concept)
Team Services
	Code Branching (concept)
	Build Agents (tool)

<h3>Bringing AI to the edge: On-premise Azure Cognitive Services using containers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Cognitive Services allow developers to build powerful AI-based solutions, enabling different capabilities in our software: vision. speech, search, text analytics, language understanding, and much more. Basically, the model is already built by Microsoft, you just need to do an API call to the Azure cloud and the service retrieves a result. For instance, you send a message and the Text Analytics API returns its sentiment score.

However, there might be cases in which our customers need a local, non-cloud AI solution (either because of limited Internet access or data compliance). This is now possible thanks to the latest update of Azure Cognitive Services, which offers containerization support. Using containers, we can still deliver ML-driven solutions while keeping the data in-house.

In this talk, we'll explore what it takes to configure and use containers in Azure Cognitive Services. Demos will be showcased as well for local Face and Text Cognitive Services.</p>

<h3>DevOPS for DBAs - Where is your magic wand?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DBA is key when a database platform change occurs and necessary to support the application, release processes and there is a miracle waiting to happen!

Based on my experience DBA is left out in the key element of DEVOPS, this is unfortunate. DBAs have a lot to offer . 
In this session let us overview where exactly DBAs can make miracles with their magic wand, let's talk about process and procedures. To evaluate each change request to ensure that it is well thought out, is compliant with organizational best practices.

Take away best practices associated in DEVOPS and DBA world.</p>

<h3>Functions and Parameters in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are situations in an analyst's life when you have to repeat same list of actions on a little bit different dataset. On the other hand, software development experience tells us to avoid repeating code which was already written and to convert it into procedure or function. On the example of public data and Google Analytics I'll show you how to group your actions in order to simplify data preparing processes.</p>
