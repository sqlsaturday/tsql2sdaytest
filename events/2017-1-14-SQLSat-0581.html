<h3>Performance Pitfalls from Code Reuse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever found yourself deconstructing endless layers of nested code? Is your T-SQL codebase written in an object-oriented format with functions  views?  Did you know that object-oriented code reuse can come at a significant penalty?  

Come to this session and learn why applying object-oriented principles can be extremely detrimental to your T-SQL's performance. You will learn how T-SQL is not like other common programming languages. We will peek inside the Query Optimizer to see how it handles these scenarios. Through extensive demos, we will explore solutions to maximize performance. You will be introduced to a T-SQL tool that will aid you in unraveling nested code. Alternate design patterns will be shown to help you mitigate these performance pitfalls.</p>

<h3>Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL DB with predicate based RLS.  


This session will show how organizational  asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/Azure SQL Database without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations. 


Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS using Power BI as a test application.</p>

<h3>How to successfully virtualize critical SQL servers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many enterprise organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  
In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by the same person writing the official SQL on VMware best practices guides.</p>

<h3>Many – to - Many: Multiple Calendars in a Single Analysis Services Multidimensional Cube</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Including the fiscal calendars of major customers within the date dimensions of their own cubes has great appeal to many organizations, including financial services firms and the like. After all, having customer calendars in their cubes' date dimension means sales and marketing managers can analyze - and report upon - data according to the fiscal calendar of the customer, as well as within the context of their own. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect, Data Platform (SQL Server and BI) MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson leads an examination into a way we can accomplish this by implementing a SQL Server Analysis Services "many-to-many" dimension scenario.   This session applies, in most respects, equally to Analysis Services (MultiDimensional) 2008R2 and above.</p>

<h3>Power BI Data Governance - Protecting Business Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session allows companies to think about the security and architecture of their Power BI deployment. Power BI is self service analytics. Users are quick to create a group work spaces without any thought. IT and organizations need to design a business friendly architecture that protects the business data without impacting the users ability to build their reports and dashboards. Users are also quick to change the data model or report without thinking of the negative impact. A strategy for delivering the changes needs to be put into place. This prevents presenting invalid reports or dashboards during the development or advancement stage of updating reports and dashboards.</p>

<h3>Save code changes on your SQL Servers with Event Notifications</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you love unknown changes?  Missing indexes?  Empty reports? Unless you have a rigid change control process, finding the culprit isn't easy! You need a list of changes, and you're probably going to have to play detective to get it, looking through change tickets, wikis, log files, or even asking coworkers. SQL Server offers this capability in many forms, but the best for larger environments is a feature called Event Notifications. While you can save code and configuration changes locally, for maximum effect you can send changes from across your environment to a centralized location in real time.  

Additionally, with it you gain other abilities, like real-time monitoring of deadlocks, warnings from SQL Server's errorlog, failed login attempts, datafile growth and more.  You can automatically provide change reports to your auditors, even add the changes to source control. Get ahead of the technical curve and go from reactive to proactive!</p>

<h3>End-to-End Troubleshooting Checklist for SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server is tough.  Often, years are spent learning how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem.  

In this session, attendees will see demonstrations of the tools and techniques which make difficult troubleshooting scenarios much faster and easier, including:

• XEvents, Profiler/Traces, and PerfMon 
• Using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
• Advanced Diagnostics Using Wait Stats
• Reading SQL Server execution plan 

Every DBA needs to know how to keep their SQL Server in tip-top condition, and you’ll need skills the covered in this session to do it.</p>

<h3>Execution Plans for Mere Mortals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This 1-hour session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache. 

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.</p>

<h3>Data Architecture 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.</p>

<h3>Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks; Tame the Sibling Rivalry</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Like parents having to break up a fight between battling siblings, SQL Server must do the same for conflicting transactions. We call these Deadlocks and they can present a problem to many DBAs. Deadlocks can be minor fights or major issues making SQL Server continually choose a side like constantly quarreling siblings.

To understand how Deadlocking occurs, we must understand what caused the fight . Learning about basic locking and blocking of SQL Server is a great place to start.

By the end of this session you will walk away with the knowledge of how the locking/blocking mechanism works, the basics of deadlocking, and what Isolation Levels are . You will know how these can help or hurt your situation.  Finally you will have the power to capture, report, and stop the family fighting.</p>

<h3>Let Me Finish... Isolating Write Operations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>OLTP databases can be constantly written to and reporting databases are written to at least periodically. In order to ensure consistent results, connections must be isolated from one another while executing, ideally with the lowest possible cost to concurrency.  How this isolation is handled is based on the isolation level, whether the classic lock based or the newer optimistic scheme of the in-memory OLTP engine is used, or even if both engines are enlisted in the same transaction. In this session we will look at examples of how SQL Server isolates reading and writing operations from other writing operations to explore how this may affect your application through error messages and performance hits.</p>

<h3>Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</p>

<h3>Building a Data Warehouse for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Users want Data Warehouses built, but no one ever builds one for the DBA. Let#39;s fix that!

Get information from Active Directory, your Windows Servers, SQL Servers and other sources that mean something and will help you to keep the databases running smoothly. Be able to see which disks/machines are low on disk, what databases are on which SQL Servers, when backups happened and if any jobs failed.

This is targeted at the DBA who is responsible for multiple SQL Servers, in multiple places, and doesn#39;t have time to quot;point and clickquot; their way to a comfortable understanding of the moving pieces on all of the systems that they need to monitor!

NOTE: This session covers how to BUILD the warehouse, how to collect information and store it in relational tables in a way that makes sense as a warehouse. I#39;m developing a follow on session that presents the collected data using BI tools.</p>

<h3>ETL Architecture for Real-Time BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For decades batch processing has been the defacto standard for Extract Transform and Load.  For most of that time 24 hour data refresh cycles were accepted as part of Business Intelligence solutions and developer skill sets have long dependent upon the reliable patterns of batch. In recent years, however, demands have begun to shift. New use cases in every industry are now causing leading edge BI solutions to demand much shorter time to realizing value. The old architecture, skills, and tools are proving insufficient to meet this demand. In this session we will look at the fundamentals of architecting real-time BI solutions, including the new categories of problems for which we will now have to solve.  Upon completing the session attendees will have a clear picture of the new skills and patterns that must be learned in order to excel in the next phase of Business Intelligence evolution.</p>

<h3>SS2014/2016 In-Memory Tables --Formula One Performance Unleashed, Part 1</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables with and without columnstore indexes over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table</p>

<h3>Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.</p>

<h3>A Key to Keys</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>So many of us have learned data modeling and database design approaches from working with one database or data technology. We may have used only one design tool.  That means our vocabularies around identifiers and keys tend to be product-specific.  Do you know the difference between a unique index and a unique key? What about the difference between RI, FK and AK? Do you know if your surrogate keys have their companion alternate keys?  Do you know about weak versus strong keys?

In this session we’ll look at the generic and proprietary terms for these concepts, as well as where they fit in the data modeling and database design process.  We’ll also look at implementation options in SQL Server 2016 -- what works, what really doesn't work, and what mistakes are commonly made in implementing keys.</p>

<h3>Autonomous Transaction Logging in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Autonomous/nested transactions are available in other database products, but are not natively supported in SQL Server. Fortunately there are several methods available to provide this functionality. 

We'll cover the standard table variable techniques to preserve data outside of transaction scope, and how the new in-memory table type can improve their performance.  Other techniques like user-defined events, CLR procedures, linked servers will also be demonstrated, and how they can enhance functionality.

We'll review minimal techniques like RAISERROR and the new SESSION_CONTEXT() feature in SQL Server 2016, to provide different levels of logging and transaction management.</p>

<h3>Working Effectively With Legacy SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A legacy code base can be a frightening thing.  Between strict deadlines, ever-evolving requirements, differing skill levels of contributors over time, and historical circumstances, keeping database code clean and concise is difficult at best.  This example- and demo-driven talk will help you build out a mental framework to prune those gnarled code bases.  Much of this talk will be familiar to software developers who know of the "clean code" philosophy, but no knowledge of the topic is necessary.  If you shudder whenever you look at your SQL code base, this talk may be for you.</p>

<p>There is no place like home, there is no place like home! When a database crashes and you have to recover it, this may be what you're saying to yourself over and over.  It can feel like a house just landed on you if you're not prepared.  Ok, not really, but recovering a database from an unexpected event is often just as terrifying! If you aren't prepared for it, it's really going to hurt.  So what do you do? You prepare. You plan. You practice.  We'll talk about how the backup  restore process works in SQL Server and how it can help you prevent a Wizard of Oz situation!</p>

<p>I am a Sales Engineer supporting our Database Performance Monitoring solutions. Prior to working in pre-sales, I spent time working in desktop and applications support, systems administration, software testing and development, and professional services. Needless to say, I've worn a lot of hats over the years. 

  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active through any means available. Traditional activities such as running and weight-training are the norm, but I find myself turning chores into opportunities to exercise. It's not uncommon to find me running behind the lawn mower. It looks silly, but I think it's fun. I also enjoy traveling for both work and play, but I'm not fond of airports.</p>
