<h3>SQL Server 2016 and R Engine-powerful duo</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With SQL Server 2016  R Language for statistical programming is now supported with native T-SQL. With this extension we can now integrate powerful R Language with transactional data directly using SSMS. With this feature data stewards and data analysts can now run from simple uni-variate to multi-variate statistics in SSMS. Implementation of R in SQL Server 2016 is one of major parts of BI Landscape. 

In this session we will go through:
1) Installation needed (R and MRO by Revolution Analytics (now Microsoft)
2) Exploring the usage of RRO Engine (multi-threated usage and parallel multi-core usage of CPU,...)
3) Using T-SQL for Data analysis with importing and exporting data to SQL Tables
4) Demos with using R in Reporting services (SSRS) and Power BI
5) Using R Engine for enhancing your daily work as DBA or BI Analyst
6) Exploring prediction engine on datasets in your daily business work
7) Use cases how and where can powerful duo make your daily business easier

Session is useful for</p>

<h3>Power Bi for beginner IoT developer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You have IoT solutions, and you get data from the sensors, now what? Of course, you would like to have, some data visualization easy and fast. You would also love to have these data is available on mobile devices.
Solutions to this problem is the Power BI these especially if you are already using Azure or Office 365.
In this presentation I will try to introduce you to Power BI with at least enough information to know where to start.
All with the demo, from hardware, to the cloud, to Power BI.</p>

<h3>The All Flash DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We are at a major turning point in the world of storage; the transition from spinning disk to flash and as we move into this new world a lot of conventional wisdom will be turned on its head. Things such as the use of compression, putting different database components on different volumes, the desire to chase large readaheads for sequential scan workloads, how well mixed workloads are handled, the multi threaded log writer and delayed durability, besides this, the session will also cover nand flash fundamentals at 300 level.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Lake Analytics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Data Lake Analytics is a new service, built to make big data analytics scalable, performance efficient and distributed and easy. Service is focused on data usability and analytics, rather than setting up the infrastructure.

Besides scaling and faster deployment, it is affordable and cost effective and easy to integrate into your existing IT environment.

For the demo, we will look at the image recognition and emotion detection.</p>

<h3>Get your data and your model ready for the Cloud using Power BI Desktop</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Introduction of a free data modelling tool (Power BI Desktop) into Power BI ecosystem have attracted great number of potential users (primarily data analysts and IT professionals) to it. During this session we will talk about and demonstrate available techniques for data retrieval and transformation as well as techniques for creation of data models that you will use as a foundation for future visualization of data in the Cloud.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Azure SQL Data Warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a SQL-based fully managed, petabyte-scale cloud data warehouse. It is highly elastic, enabling you to provision in minutes and scale capacity in seconds. You can scale compute and storage independently, allowing you to burst compute for complex analytical workloads or scale down your warehouse for archival scenarios, and pay based off what you're using instead of being locked into predefined cluster configurations - helping you derive even more cost efficiency versus traditional data warehouse solutions.</p>

<h3>Cardinality Estimator with SQL Server 2014 and 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cardinality Estimator had a major upgrade in SQL Server 2014 version and 2016. After a few introductory words, I will speak about model assumptions of Cardinality Estimator, calculation direction, model selection of Cardinality Estimator and improvements in SQL Server versions 2014 and 2016. I will also have a few demos where I will demonstrate how to optimally use the new features.</p>

<h3>SQL Server on Linux</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ono što je do jučer bilo nezamislivo sada je postala realnost. Sigurno nikada niste niti pomislili da će Microsoft krenuti sa open source inicijativom, a da ne govorimo o podršci za Linux. SQL Server je dobio svoju verziju za Linux, tačnije rečeno nekoliko trenutno najpopularnijih distribucija (Ubuntu, SUSE i Red Hat). Da li se radi o istom SQL Server okruženju i mogućnostima? Šta je brže, bolje i kvalitetnije i da li ima uopšte smisla da razmišljate o ovome? Saznajte na ovom predavanju.</p>

<h3>Problem Solving With The In-Memory Engine</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There is a vast array of material in the SQL Server community that covers the in-memory engine in great detail, this session will cover some of the internals of the in-memory engine, however what it will also do is fill in the void as to common performance issues and how they can be solved with the in-memory engine, specifically:

- Staging data as fast as possible
- Turbo charging scalar aggregate functions
- Implementing a scalable sequence
- Overcoming the performance limitations of temporary tables
- Making the critical path in your code base run faster</p>

<h3>Parameter Sniffing Problem with Stored Procedures</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Your stored procedure is slow in the application, but works perfect in SSMS! In this presentation it will be clarified why this happens and why parameter sniffing is a problem in SQL Server stored procedures. Of course, several solutions will be presented  and it will be discussed which solution is applicable in which scenario.</p>
