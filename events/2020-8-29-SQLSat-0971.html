<h3>Chaos Engineering for SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we will explore the concept of Chaos Engineering, its core concepts, and how it has been implemented at various companies.

Then we'll look at how it can be implemented with regard to SQL Server. SQL has various different high availability solutions but can you be sure that they'll react as expected to a real world issue? Has your HA architecture only ever been tested in a planned maintenance window?

We'll also have some fun by looking at KubeInvaders, a chaos engineering tool for Kubernetes...using Space Invaders!

This session is for SQL Server DBAs and Developers who want to know how Chaos Engineering works and want to learn its main principles.</p>

<h3>My Power BI Report is Slow: What Should I Do?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?

This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.

At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.</p>

<h3>Data is all around - so how do you control it? ​</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is all around. And as the value of data has become clear for most businesses, they are eager to start using it to get better insights. Still, as the sources, users and need for data increases, the job to ensure that your data is used the way it was intended throughout the company becomes challenging. How do you enable your business to take full advantage of your data?

In this session, I will present how data governance and particularly the augmented data catalog can tackle this issue. In addition, we will have a look at how such a data catalog can act as a tool for the developers. How it can help bridge the gap between the business and the developer. And also why Gartner believes that an augmented data catalog is a key component for data lake projects to deliver value.</p>

<h3>Monitoring service quality with Artificial Intelligence</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Since you often have the task of document recognition, text evaluation or image rating in Office 365, I show you the link to Cognitive Services, where you can generate various added values for your Office 365 project using image and text recognition methods. I use function calls for the direct call of the Cognitive Services and show you how you can directly access external API (of the Cognitive Services).

The example in this session is about the evaluation of the service quality of the #SQLKellner. It explains step by step how to assemble all components to get a "Service AI Power App" that runs on every smartphone or tablet.

The list of ingredients includes Cognitive Services (AI), Power Apps, an Azure SQL DB, a Logic App and Power BI.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters: Make SQL Server your Data Hub for everything</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS and Spark!

In this session we are going to explore the capabilities of the exciting new feature. How does it work and how can we work with datasets that are non-relational?</p>

<h3>Consolidation best practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You performed a consolidation of your databases, but you run into performance problems. Having many databases in a SQL Server Instance is a common solution. It reduces licensing and hardware costs. But to have a solution like this working according to the SLAs we need to pay a special attention on the way we implement Instance level consolidation. There are some important rules to follow from the very beginning of the project. How to group databases and which databases are not to be consolidated is just the first worth mentioning. Performance monitoring and resource usage analysis becomes even more important in a consolidated environment. In this session I will talk about important things to consider when you have to design, implement, monitor and support a consolidated SQL Server Instance which serves many apps. You will see some good and bad practices from real projects, you will have a list of practical advices and even scripts to use in your environment.</p>

<h3>Best Practices for building a Data Lake with Azure Databricks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Databricks is a Unified Analytics Platform making it easier than ever to do big data analytics on cloud. However, there are a lot of things you need to know and take into account before diving head first into a Data Lake. This session is intended for architects and developers who are looking to build a massive scale data storing and processing solution. I will go through the Best Practices for the purpose. In addition, I will demonstrate how to unify real-time and batch processing using Azure Databricks. As a result, you should feel comfortable building your own Data Lake for your big data processing needs.</p>

<h3>Statistics, an unreliable friend.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You learned that your statistics should be regularly updated. You even implemented Ola Hallengren's maintenance scripts. That should be enough, right? What if it's not?
Join me on some head-ache, a dive into statistics histograms, fun with flags and a praise to the evolution of SQL Server optimizer.
Much of this session is about the "ascending key problem", and how Microsoft have made shanges to the SQL Server optimizer to improve, but not completely eliminate the problem.</p>

<h3>SQL Titbits for the Inexperienced</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is directed to you who have been using SQL left-handedly a year or so. You have learnt to write the basic queries, but there are still some gaps in your SQL knowledge, and overall SQL is a little confusing to you. This session aims at filling some of these gaps by covering a few titbits about SQL and give you some tips that will be useful to you. This includes really basic things as what GO really is and the traps you can run into with NULL values. You will also learn a little about data types and how you should use UNION. Finally, I will talk about CTEs, temp tables and table variables and you will get some ideas what to use when.</p>

<h3>From adaptive to intelligent: query processing in SQL 2019</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As announced in September 2018, SQL Server 2019 expands the "adaptive query processing" features of SQL 2017 and relabels them as "intelligent query processing". This name now covers many features, such as batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptive joins, deferred compilation, and approximate query processing.

In this high-paced session, we will look at all these features and cover some use cases where they might help - or hurt! - you.</p>

<h3>Four Steps to Securing your Data Platform</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is valuable, really valuable, but in many cases security is an afterhought to getting things done. But this approach can come at a cost, quite a heavy one in the event of a GDPR or PCI-DSS breach.

In this session we will look at four key elements that are integral to data platform security and how to implement them. By adopting a 'Secure by Design' approach you will reduce risk while also delivering value.</p>

<h3>Use parameters to add extra flexibility to your Power BI content</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You're probably applying a lot of steps over and over again every time you create your Power BI report. A waste of time! Apply parameters on the back-end in Power Query, but also in the front-end in your report to make your solutions much more flexible.

<h3>Benchmarking in the Cloud</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Lifting and shifting your application to the cloud is extremely easy, on paper. The hard truth is that the only way to know for sure how it is going to perform is to test it. Benchmarking on premises is hard enough, but benchmarking in the cloud can get really hairy because of the restrictions in PaaS environments and the lack of tooling.
Join me in this session and learn how to capture a production workload, replay it to your cloud database and compare the performance. I will introduce you to the methodology  and the tools to bring your database to the cloud without breaking a sweat.</p>
