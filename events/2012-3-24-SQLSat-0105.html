<h3>SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a cooking analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.</p>

<h3>Effective Data Management using Data Compression</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I present this session @ Red Gate SQL-in-the-City Conference (London - July 2011)This session will explain the basic principles of SQL Server's data compression feature, how it functions, what options you can choose, and how it performs under differing workloads. We will look at how to integrate data compression into your current schema designs and the challenges you will likely encounter, examining the all-important performance aspects and the configuration changes to consider along with SKU editions requirements. We will also look @ Red Gate's "SQL Storage Compress" product to show how their data compression tool can tackle these data growth challenges in a different manner.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with MDX:  The (Very) Basics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

<h3>Build a monitoring system with Powershell Remoting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>
My last session on managing large environments turned out to be more talk than proof, it contained a bunch of war stories and almost no demos.
This session will be the other way around, we're going to spend most of our time in powershell and we'll build a whole monitoring system from scratch.
I'll use powershell remoting and real world demo's based on my own day to day practice.
To keep the promise of a level 300 session I'll spend some time in the beginning to explain the concepts of powershell remoting,
after which I'll build a monitoring system step by step in the second part of the session.</p>
