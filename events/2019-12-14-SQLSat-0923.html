<h3>10 Steps Towards Global Data Compliance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data compliance in the modern technology landscape feels like a constantly moving target as more and different laws, rules and regulations are passed locally, nationally and internationally. The days when only some organizations or certain countries had to worry about data compliance are gone. It’s everyone’s problem.

However, it is possible to define a core set of processes that will help to enable your ability to assist your business, or government agency, in meeting these compliance requirements. This session will walk you through the 10 steps you need to implement in order to move your organization towards full compliance with any, or all, of the regulations we all now face. From identifying where your data lives to monitoring for compliance and all the steps in between, you can meet this challenge.</p>

<h3>CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</p>

<h3>When to use Indexing Pro Features</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using the right index for the right scenario can be the "go fast" button that keeps queries and customers happy. 

Over the years, Microsoft has given us many different indexing options and flavors. Today there are many more considerations beyond "clustered or non clustered". We'll cover all those different flavor options: Filtered, Compressed, Columnstore, included columns, and Partitioning. 

We won't only talk about what these options are, we'll also cover how and when to use these different indexing options, and how to make sure you have enough--but not too many--indexes for your workload.</p>

<h3>Docker for the SQL Server Developer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Containerization with Docker is a hot topic these days, and SQL Server’s ability to run in-side Docker containers on both Windows and Mac has revolutionized the way develop-ers work with Microsoft’s venerable database engine. This dynamic session starts with a quick introduction to Docker and how it utilizes OS virtualization in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019 to provide isolation across multiple containers running on your machine. Then you’ll see how fast and easy it is to spin up any number of SQL Server in-stances to run in both Windows and Linux containers simultaneously. Get bit by the Docker bug, and you’ll never go through the pain of installing SQL Server on your devel-opment machine ever again!</p>

<h3>Performance Troubleshooting for the Accidental DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Were you roped into “taking care” of SQL Server, gaining the “coveted” title DBA? (Had you only known…)

Do you have to deal with frequent performance problems like the app throwing timeouts at the users or the daily reports closing in on 24 hours runtime?

Does it seem, constant blocking or frequent deadlocks are now a common part of your daily agenda?
So, how do you even know where to start? Do you “add more indexes”, “increase memory”, “buy a new SAN”, “update statistics”, “move to the cloud”, or something else entirely?

The good news: SQL Server provides the tools you need to clear the fog and identify exactly what the problem is.

In this session, we’ll take a look at the query store, wait stats, live execution plans and more. After attending you’ll have the tools you need to be able to quickly identify the exact culprit in any low-performance situation.

And, next time your boss breathes down your neck, you might even be able to point out that SQL Server is not the problem.</p>

<h3>Data Virtualization with PolyBase</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.</p>

<h3>Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When it comes to getting your data into Excel or Power BI, M is your best choice. The M Language (A.K.A Power Query) is a powerful tool for self-service data preparation. However, it's not clear where it fits compared to tools like SSIS or TSQL. It's also not clear what it's limitations are. This session will cover the basics of M and when to use it.

In this session, we'll demonstrate how M is a linear series of transformations, just like a set of steps from a recipe. We'll show how 80% of what you will ever need to do can be done from the GUI. We'll also talk about how to write custom code for that other 20%. By the end of this presentation, you'll be able to take any manual cleanup you do today and turn it into a repeatable process with M.</p>

<h3>Two Truths That's A Lie: Data Visualization Ethics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data visualization is an impactful and influential method of telling a story, so it’s important to be as open and truthful as possible when telling your story. The Society of Professional Journalists have a code of ethics that begins with a single mission, “Seek Truth and Report It”, but what is truth in data? Data can tell multiple stories. How do we protect our company and reputation?

In this session, we will discuss how everything from color to chart can be used to change the meaning of visualization. We will cover the things that influence and manipulate. Finally, we will put it all together, creating two opposing stories using the same data-set.</p>

You'll discover that concurrency isn't just about locking and blocking; concurrency is also about hardware. I'm going to teach you how to diagnose your worst server issues and practical ways to solve them.</p>
