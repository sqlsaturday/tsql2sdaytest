<h3>BI For (Almost) Everyone</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business Intelligence was for a long time considered something only the "big" companies could do or afford. However in the recent past with shifts in technology paradigms, BI has become a commodity affordable by many. You too can do BI if you have the right edition (and version) of SQL Server.
This session will showcase how data in an OLTP database can be converted into BI-worthy data: using the SQL Server 2012 Database Engine, Analysis Services and finally visualizing with Excel; along with references to SSIS, SSRS, PowerPivot and PowerView on the way.</p>

<h3>SQL Server 2008 Database Internals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you already wanted to know how SQL Server 2008/2012 stores a database file physically on the hard drive? In this session you will learn the internal structure of a SQL Server 2008/2012 database file, and how SQL Server stores tables and indices internally in the file system. Furthermore you will see the DBCC T-SQL command in action, with which you can analyse the internal storage format of your database files. All these information from this session helps you in your next database design to get out the last percent of performance from your new database solution.</p>
