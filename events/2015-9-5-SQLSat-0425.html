<h3>Load Testing With SQL Server Tools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s often difficult to know how your SQL Servers will perform under different loads. By performing load testing, we can gain these key insights, perform modifications to existing configurations, and understand the impact on performance levels.

Come learn about the native tools at our disposal for performing these important load tests and how we can identify when performance levels begin to drop. Using demos of these native tools – including Distributed Replay Utility (DRU), Database Tuning Adviser (DTA), Perfmon, Extended Events, and Profiler – we’ll see how to plan and perform a load test project, gain an understanding of SQL Server’s performance under varying load scenarios, and discover which tell-tale indicators can help alert us to performance degradation.</p>

<h3>RC, SI, and RCSI, Oh My! –We're off to see the Wizard -to understand how it all works.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.</p>

<h3>tSQLt - Database Unit Testing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Everyone writes perfect SQL code, but sometimes things happen that make your code run in weird and unexpected ways.
Or you are that lucky person that has to make changes to business critical code, where a mistake can put you on a fist name basis with the CEO.

Sure, we have testing departments that will check our code, and some of us have to test our code ourselves. 
But you might still end up lying awake at night wondering about that edge case scenario.

Testing takes time, and database tables have foreign keys and constraints and all sorts of other things that make it hard to get the system into a specific state. Then you change your code and have to do it all over again.

tSQLt allows you to prepare your database for a test, and once the test is run the database is set back like nothing happened. All that remains is whether your test succeeded.

We will go through setting up the framework, how to write tests and run them - either manually or as part of your build process

<h3>Analytics Platform System - SQL 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse vs SQL 201x</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will cover some of the key fundamentals that differentiate SMP SQL from MPP SQL (SQL 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse vs SQL 201x) . 
I will go over some of the architectural implementations that make MPP SQL Possible, and that offer its ground breaking performance. Will also briefly cover scenarios where APS will shine and scenarios which are not ideal for APS as well as some of the current limitations on APS. 
I have access to an actual APS appliance (AU3) so we will be running side by side queries on a comparative SQL 201x Environment and then on the APS to show the performance of an APS as a data warehousing solution. 
Some of the specific side by side comparisons we will run: 
Data Loads - BCP, SSIS and BULK INSERT vs DWLoader.exe 
Data Transformation - CTAS, CRTAS
BI Demonstration - Connecting Excel directly to 30 million + rows and doing a real time pivot without a cube off the back of APS. 
Lastly will cover some of the hybrid hadoop functionality with APS CETAS</p>

<h3>SQL Server and the Data Management Practice</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SQL Server is NOT recognised as a platform that can deliver a Data Management Practise! How do we use SQL Server technologies to achieve data maturity? Data is a very important asset and you need a comprehensive strategy to manage it correctly.
Using SQL Server technologies to build a DAMA framework we will explore how to map the technologies onto the DAMA wheel which is divided into 11 principles: Data Governance, Data Architecture, Data Design  Modelling, Data Storage  Operations, Data Security, Data Integration  Interoperability, Unstructured Data, Reference  Master Data, Data Warehousing  Business Intelligence, Metadata  and Data Quality Management.
Technologies such as DQS and Azure Data Catalog are used to achieve Data Quality Management. Power BI and PowerQuery will be mapped onto the Warehousing  BI sector of the DAMA framework. The SQL Engine ensures Data Security. A comprehensive set of mappings will be provided.
The Data Managemnt Trainline is a set of pat</p>

<h3>Backups? What backups?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>That’s never something you want to hear. Unfortunately it tends to be heard far too often.
In this introductory session, we’ll look at backups, backups and more backups (because there’s no such thing as too many backups)

We’ll look at full backups, what they are and how often they should be run.
We’ll look at differential backups, how they fit into backup strategies and the pitfalls you may encounter when using them.
We’ll look at transaction log backups, at why they are an essential part of the backup strategy for important databases and at what happens when transaction log backups go wrong.

<h3>Data Warehouse Schema Design and Evolution</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>

•         Completely
•         Normalized
•         Moderately de-normalized
•         Completely de-normalized

<h3>Performance Troubleshooting Using DMVs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Performance troubleshooting is a complex subject with many factors under consideration when you find poorly performing SQL statements, using proven methodologies, and evaluating performance data available in the Dynamic Management Views and Functions. In this session, we’ll go over a foundation of how and which DMVs to use to identify those problematic statements for versions of SQL Server from 2005 – 2014.

We’ll be demonstrating using practical examples, including code that can be taken away and used on attendees’ own SQL Servers. We’ll also discuss how to identify common causes of performance issues, and learn how to quickly review and understand the wealth of performance data available</p>

<h3>Data Profiling in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We always struggled to get our code to work as per specification due to bad data quality. Sandesh will illustrate and make you realize that Data Profiling is a necessary precursor for designing any kind of system that use data. Data profiling is a method of assessing any data in a systematic and analytical way. The goal of data profiling is to give an exhaustive information detailing the content, context, and quality of data. Data profiling leads to better data integration, which leads to better data quality.</p>

<h3>Lies, Damned Lies And Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wondered what the things called statistics are, why they're important and what needs to be done to maintain them? If so, this session is for you!

<h3>Power to the people!!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power Pivot and Power View provide new and innovative ways for end users to view their data and to convert this data to valuable information. Enabling and convincing end users to take ownership of their data (as Data Stewards) is half the challenge, and in practice is not all that problematic.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking at practical ways and means of creating reports, utilizing Power Pivot and Power View. We shall take advantage of the BISM and have our data stored within a SQL Server tabular database. All examples come from actual implementations and we shall be looking at the constructive feedback provided by end users.
