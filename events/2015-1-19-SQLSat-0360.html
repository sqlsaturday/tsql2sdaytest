<h3>SQL CLR from 2005 to 20015, Not how, but why and when</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>2005, Big buzz…. Microsoft added a NEW FEATURE to the SQL Server, which allow users to extend the Server abilities, by importing external CLR libraries. Hundreds of articles and discussions were held around the same time, asking: is Transact-SQL dead? Today we are celebrating Tenth Birthday to CLR feature, and it is best time to open the discussion and get some insights regarding this OLD FEATURE.

In this session we are going to focus on the questions WHY to use SQLCLR, and not less important WHEN to use it over transact-SQL. We are not going to talk about HOW to use it. We are going to demonstrate the SQLCLR abilities in practice (all code will be publish latter), we are going to compare different solutions, explain why you have to use it, and show that in practice we all using SQLCLR, yet most DBAs do not write their own code. As part of the demonstrations, we will show how to implement new features from SQL server 2012 / 2014 on older versions.

<h3>Big Data: Become a data engineer or kick the bucket!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a long time database consultant, and the current CTO of Xplenty, I've seen many organizations taking in new data technologies and handling the changes with various degrees of success, as well as how these changes affected the data team within the organization.

In this talk I'll discuss the rapid technological changes in the Big Data and NoSQL world and the implications to a business adopting these technologies. 

One outcome of adopting big data technology is that it's not easily accessible to people who touch data on a daily basis, which may quickly become a bottleneck in the organization. Turning into a full-fledged Data Engineer can be challenging, but it is possible. I'll discuss the skills DBAs and BI people need to learn and unlearn in order to work under new data paradigms. I will also review various new and emerging tools as well as integration with older platforms that allow for smoother migration into the new world.

<h3>SQL Server Reporting Services Best Practices</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Reporting Services is a phenomenal tool to get the ‘good word’ out to management. Working with Reporting Services can be challenging at times (to say the least) and one learns to work with its subtleties and nuances.
In this hands on presentation, we shall be discussing some best practices that one should follow during the project life cycle from development to the production and implementation phases.
We shall be discussing the pros and cons of utilizing shared datasets, the pluses and pitfalls of utilizing embedded reports, report utilization logging, utilization of graphics and the portability of solutions from one server to another.

<h3>Managing a BI Project Successfuly</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do we measure the success of a BI Project?How can we assure the customer is pleased with the project result?BI Projects pose a considerable challenge and successful management has always been an elusive part of the BI Development life cycle.In this session we will review these concepts and receive tips and guidelines. we will be reviewing real life scenarios.Audience participation is encouraged!</p>

<h3>Advanced Query Tuning Techniques</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You identified a query that is causing performance issues, and your mission is to optimize it and boost performance. You looked at the execution plan and created all the relevant indexes. You even updated statistics, but performance is still bad. Now what?
In this session we will analyze common use cases of poorly performing queries, such as improper use of scalar functions, inaccurate statistics and bad impact of parameter sniffing. We will learn through extensive demos how to troubleshoot these use cases and how to boost performance using advanced and practical techniques. By the end of this session, you'll have a list of tips and techniques to apply on your environment.</p>

<h3>The Data Loading Performance Presentation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft has a famous whitepaper called "The Data Loading Performance Guide".
The problem is that it's long and full of small details, and we're too lazy to read it. 

On this session, we will turn the whitepaper into a presentation and see a few advanced ways to boost your data loading processes.  

Among other topics, we will talk about: 

•	Minimal Logging 
•	Transaction Management
•	Bulk Loading Methods
•	Indexing Techniques for High Performance Data Loading
•	Properly Leveraging Parallelism and Partitioning
•	SQL Server 2014 Delayed Durability

<h3>Delayed Durability - SQL Server goes wild</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The first time SQL Server brakes the ACID model, this is the biggest change in the engine in a long time.

See why delayed durability is one of the most important features in years and the one that can make SQL Server a valid competitor for high throw put No-SQL systems</p>

<h3>Rethink Your Data Model and Make It Super Fast</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Sometimes you really need an EAV model. In most cases they are ugly and slow.
After this session you will have gained new insights how to turn your old, slow, EAV model into a slim superfast model.

There will be real life examples from a recent project. With the techniques displayed in the presentation, I cut the execution time down from 134 days down to 0.5 seconds and cut the storage need from 550GB to 45GB.

<h3>harnessing the GPU power for Big Data Analytic </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today modern graphics cards have a lot of computing power for example the Nvida flagship card Tesla K40 has 2880 cores and is able to peform 4.29 T operations per second !!.
In this  lecture I will represent the principles of developing for applications for GPU and I'll  discuses the advantages and the limitation  of using the GPU (graphic process unit) on big databases . 
I'll presents some interesting benchmarks we've  done on a GPU database vs RDBMS and columanr database and we'll try to predict the future in the area.</p>

<h3>Native File Streaming with SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this dynamic session, Lenni will teach you the ins-and-outs of unstructured data storage and native file streaming with FILESTREAM (introduced in SQL Server 2008) and FileTable (new in SQL Server 2012). Learn how to program FILESTREAM using T-SQL and, for maximum performance, using the OpenSqlFileStream API in C#. We’ll also cover the hierarchyid data type, which casts a hierarchical structure over every FileTable, and wrap up with the full-text search improvements and new Statistical Semantic Search in SQL Server 2012 that you can leverage to get the most out of unstructured documents contained in your databases.</p>
