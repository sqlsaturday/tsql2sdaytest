<h3>Query Tuning Mastery: Manhandling Parallelism</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In today's multi-core-driven world, query performance is very much determined by how well you're taking advantage of the processing power at your disposal. In this session you will learn how to take full advantage of parallelism, from a developer's point of view. After a quick terminology review and technology refresher the session will go deep, covering T-SQL patterns that allow certain queries to scale almost linearly across your multi-core CPUs. Not all T-SQL queries can go parallel, so you'll also learn to watch for those things that can restrict the query optimizer's decisions. Along the way you'll learn to manipulate costs and row goals, challenge generally accepted tuning practices, and take complete control of your parallel queries.</p>

<h3>Super-size Your SSIS Breakfast Sandwich: Performan</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Importing data is as common to SQL Server as bacon is to a savory breakfast sandwich. As most of us love to eat those breakfast sandwiches, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) loves to eat data in an Import/Export kind of way. Although a green chain of boxes in SSIS can be the ruling “Happy Dance” of any DBA or SQL Developer, we must still consider the performance of those tasks. In this session, we will go through performance tuning in SSIS 2012 after a successful SSIS package has been developed. When we are finished with this session, not only will you still have the mystic of green colors of successful execution of your SSIS import and export tasks, but the turbo boosters will be turned on as well.

<h3>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</p>

<h3>SQL Server is the Least of My Problems!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve finally gotten your first job working with SQL Server (SS) as the junior DBA at company XYZ. All the studying, the classes, the pricey SS certification exams,  the User Group attendance has paid off.

Your first day at the job your boss walks you through some new job duties. He wants you to remote out to the server to look at the file directory where the FTP process writes the encrypted files  make sure the file share didn’t disappear when the cluster failed over. You slip away to the bathroom, lock yourself in a stall, have a seat and rock side to side muttering -What is he talking about?I thought there would be tables.

If this sounds familiar this session is for you. Learn about the SS ecosystem  how to navigate it as a new</p>

<h3>Being the Swiss Army Knife of DB Pros</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Being a specialist means you're really, really good at one thing. Being a generalist means you're good at a a lot of different things. The generalist has an advantage over the specialist because he or she can see and solve problems the specialists can't. In this session I'll cover why it's important to diversify your skill set, not only for career protection, but to be better as a database professional. We'll look at what skill sets to build on to expand your abilities around SQL Server to include the operating system, development, networks, and security. Remember, this saying isn't complete, "Jack of all trades, master of none." The full saying is, "Jack of all trades, master of none, though often times better than master of one."</p>

<h3>Working with Server Side Traces</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You may have heard that it’s a good idea to use a server-side trace to capture SQL profiler data, but do you know how to create one? And, do you know how to process the data you’ve captured?  If not, then this session is for you.

First, we’ll examine the anatomy of a server-side trace script and look at the different ways it can be customized. Then, we’ll talk about methods for stopping and starting the trace, how to know what traces are already running, and ways to schedule a trace to start under certain server conditions. Last, we’ll look at different tools available to you for analyzing the data you’ve gathered, including the SQL Server Profiler client application, “home-grown” T-SQL queries, ClearTrace, and the ReadTrace.</p>

<p>Most database professionals know (from firsthand experience) that there continues to be a "data explosion", and there's been a lot of focus lately on "big data".  But what do you do when your data's just kind of "biggish"?  You're managing Terabytes, not Petabytes, and you're trying to squeeze out as much performance out of your aging servers as possible.  The focus of this session is to identify some key guidelines for the design, management, and ongoing optimization of "larger-than-average" databases. Special attention will be paid to the following areas: * query design * logical and physical data structures * maintenance  backup strategies </p>

<h3>Tuning Analysis Services Processing Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’ve got your Analysis Services cube created, and deployed in production. However, you notice that every night, the cube is taking longer and longer to process, and users are starting to complain about their data not being ready when they arrive in the morning. If you’ve found yourself in this situation, or want to avoid being in it in the first place, come to this session. We’ll cover how to benchmark processing performance, track down bottlenecks, and how to tune things to get the best performance for processing your cube.</p>

<h3>Concurrency in PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Moore's law is not dead; it lives on as CPU manufacturers add more and more CPU cores to the same chip real estate.  In this session, we will look at the ways in which you can leverage concurrent processing in your PowerShell code to dramatically increase the efficiency of your code.  Speed up those ETL processes, execute code on multiple servers at the same time, and complete your maintenance tasks much faster using the techniques you will learn.</p>

<h3>The Decoder Ring for Data Warehousing / BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Business Intelligence is one of the hottest job skills in the IT field. DBAs and Database Developers are being asked to implement databases with non-traditional design, and are having a lot of new vocabulary thrown their way. In this talk you will learn the concepts behind building and designing data warehouses, and cut through the buzz words so you will walk away with a clear understanding of what words like dimensions, facts, and measures mean.</p>

<h3>Think Outside the Group! Take MDX to the next leve</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Reporting Services is a powerful tool that can make designing reports a snap...most of the time. But every once in a while you have to format a report very specifically, and that starts with your data query.  In this session, we'll think outside the group! Learn about how to use named sets, dummy members, and other MDX tricks to craft your queries in a way that allows you to conquer the trickiest report layouts.</p>

<h3>Execution Plans a Deep Dive</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s one thing to know to look for scans instead of seeks, but if you really want to know what’s going on in an execution plan, you need to dive deep. This session will cover reading execution plans from the basics, but goes way beyond the basics to cover as much of the information available within an execution plan as you might possibly ever need. We’ll go into how to understand how to interpret parameter sniffing and spot when a join operation is not performing the way you would want. We’ll use the graphical plan and the XML behind to thoroughly explore execution plans. </p>

<p>Learn Windows PowerShell best practices as they apply to each stage of the script development lifecycle. See the differences between working interactively from the Windows PowerShell prompt, writing an inline script, adding basic function, advanced functions and finally the implementation of Windows PowerShell Modules. What is a local best practice for Windows PowerShell development is not the same as a global best practice, and this talk covers those differences</p>
