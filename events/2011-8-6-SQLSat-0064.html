<h3>Unraveling Tangled Code–Tale of Victory Over Chaos</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled 
with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible 
to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One 
might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If 
you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you 
break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for 
conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding 
mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, 
turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. </p>

<h3>Getting the most out of SharePoint Search</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The number one complaint about Enterprise Search is usually summed up by a statement like this: “I can’t find anything!”. Whether you are using SharePoint Foundation with Search Server Express, SharePoint Server 2010, or FAST Search for SharePoint, the quality of the results you receive from search is only as good as the input you give it. Out-of-the-box, SharePoint gives you a very functional search engine, but you need to do some work to really enable the full power it provides. This intro level talk will teach you the basics of Enterprise Search in SharePoint. Here you will learn about the basic building blocks such as content sources, crawled properties, managed properties, and scopes. </p>

<h3>Creating a Metadata Mart w/ SSIS - Data Governance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture, via SSIS, that rely on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(development effort) for generating the code required vs manual coding. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts.  </p>

<h3>Data in the Stream: Introducing StreamInsight</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Introduced as a part of the Sql Server 2008 R2 platform, StreamInsight is Microsoft's Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine. It allows you to analyze and process large volumes of data - think tens to hundreds of thousands of events per second - with sub-second response time. It's as close to real time as you can get without quantum entanglement! The Sql Server engine may be fast ... but it's just not that fast. 
This presentation will introduce core CEP concepts and sample uses cases and then dive into kinkiness with real-time data, including hosting StreamInsight, getting data into (and out of) the engine, how time is handled, writing queries in Linq and how to extend the StreamInsight engine.
It's a whole new paradigm of looking at data</p>

<h3>TSQL Brush-up: The Best Things You Forgot You Knew</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’re a good SQL professional –  some piece of T-SQL slips by you unnoticed, or falls out of memory. Most of us are working with at least two or three out of the last five versions of SQL Server, so who can blame us for missing a feature or two? Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements. In this session you will see SELECT turned inside-out. You’ll get really, really excited about OVER and PARTITION BY. You’ll learn that Common Table Expressions are, in fact, very cool, and that FOR XML isn’t as scary as it looks. And what’s more, we’ll look and BRAND-new features like SQL Server Denali’s new SEQUENCE object!</p>

<h3>Get a Lever and Pick Any Turtle: Lifting with Meta</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Integrated metadata is a required element of all RDBMSs. In addition to ANSI INFORMATION_SCHEMA and metadata on implementation-specific features like indexes, SQL Server also offers a very powerful extended properties feature. In this talk, I cover using the basic metadata combined with extended properties and demonstrate practical usage to organize and document a system's design and monitor the health of a system's compliance with design rules.</p>

<h3>EntityFramework 360: Getting Started</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not. Unfortunately, binding these two platforms together can result in significant amounts of lost productivity and a less than optimal solution.

Come see how you can resolve this recurring theme with the Microsoft ADO.NET Entity Framework.  In this session, we’ll…

•	Explore the Entity Framework 4, its components and see how it all works
•	Generate a business object model with database mappings, demonstrating database-first, model-first and code-only approaches
•	Walk through a variety of code examples that show how to interact with the model
•	Show how the Entity Framework automatically tracks data changes and generates updates
•	Deep-dive </p>

<h3>Building a Maintainable Model w/ EF Code-First</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The whiz-bang visual designer features of the Entity Framework demo well, and may even work for small projects, but anyone who's worked with EF knows that on larger projects, the design surface quickly becomes unusable and a bottleneck to your development process. Thankfully, the Entity Framework team has heard our anguished cries and introduced a new API for defining your EF models, dubbed "Code-First". In this presentation, Brian will guide you through building a true POCO model, basic mapping techniques, and leveraging conventions to keep your mappings DRY.</p>

<h3>Back to Basics - Threading in .NET</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Multi-core processors are becoming pretty prevalent for most business user's workstations these days. This trend has increased the benefits for developer's to take advantage of multiple threads in applications. While not every application will benefit from being multi-threaded this programming tool should be in every .NET developers tool belt. Unfortunately in my experience the majority of .NET developers are not comfortable with this programming paradigm and are afraid to ask. This session dives into the basics behind threads, outlines all the different threading options in .NET, and then walks through programming examples using .NET 2.0 and 4.0. </p>

<p>Have you ever wondered who made a change to your structures or data?  Do you need to find out who has permissions to do what in your system?  This session will take you on a tour of auditing for internal, SOX or HIPPA Compliance.  


How much of a summary do you need?  Or will this work?  I will go into some data forensics as well, but to keep it within the time limit, I will structure it to structural changes, not so much the data itself, though the same techniques apply.
