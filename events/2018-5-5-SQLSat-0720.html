<h3>Code Like a Snake Charmer - Intro to Python!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Python is the one of the most popular programming languages used today and one of the most useful tools in the data scientist's tool belt especially for machine learning. Python is integrated into the Microsoft stack in tools like Azure ML and now SQL Server 2017.

The session will be an introduction to the Python language including: 

1.) Installing and Configuring Python
2.) Access and Manipulate Data
3.) Install and Manage Packages
4.) Create and Use Objects/Variables
5.) Control Flows and Functions
6.) Managing the Python installation in MSSQL

Attend this session to learn how to use Python to take your data analytics to the next level. We will use Python, SQL Server and the Anaconda distribution of Python to learn the basics of Python and how it is integrated in the Microsoft stack! We will walk through a simple deployment of a machine learning model to see how it all works together and learns some basic data science fundamentals.

No prior statistics knowledge needed.</p>

<h3>Accelerating Development and Testing Using Data Virtualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Constraining everything in development and testing is database size.  Storage is a bottleneck, and while faster SSD/Flash is available, it is still too expensive due to the size of many databases, especially in DEV and TEST.  More to the point, it takes a lot of time to push terabytes around, and time itself is expensive.  The old joke about "good, fast, and cheap -- pick any two" is so true with data.

Providing full databases for each developer or tester on each task of each project seems unrealistic, when each copy might require terabytes of storage, so for decades everyone has limited themselves to working in shared dev/test environments that are refreshed only every few months, where conflicts occur,  quality suffers, and things move slowly.

Come learn why data virtualization is the solution to a problem everyone knows.

Good, fast, and cheap -- have all three with data virtualization.  Be able to clone data quickly, and remove the biggest constraint to development and testing.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline

Performance assessment and tuning for the beginner DBA
 
Have you ever inherited a group of servers with not a lot of documentation to accompany them?   Do you have a lot of undocumented or new servers in your environment and you want to establish some baseline configuration setting prior to making changes? You need up to date information on the system very quickly. 
 
The server is running slowly... or is it? Slow compared to what?  Before you being digging into performance issues, there are some baseline metrics you should have established. Only after the information has been gathered, can a plan of attack be developed to help resolve issues with performance. Attendees in this session will learn how to quickly  gather information, review the results and get an action plan on the next step in performance tuning.</p>

<h3>Make Power BI Your Own with the Power BI APIs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI makes accessing data from various sources and building advanced visualizations for analytics easy to do. Behind the scenes Power BI is built on standard technologies and APIs that allow it to be customized in multiple ways to fit in with your environment the way you need it to. In this session we will walk though samples and demos that show how you can extend Power BI with custom visualizations, access custom data sources, embed various Power BI elements in your applications, and be able to push your data into a Power BI report/dashboard. Each of these items take advantage of the Power BI APIs in different ways and we will discuss each and provide the code samples for you to take back and get a head start. This session will be showing code to access the Power BI REST API using C# and NodeJS along with some M for accessing and manipulating custom data sources.</p>

<h3>The Ultimate Maintenance Plan</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is your SQL Server running slower and slower? Do you prefer a proactive rather than a reactive approach to managing SQL Server? Do you worry about being able to recover in an emergency? If you answer yes to any of the above this session is for you. 

We will start by exploring some of the maintenance options that are available. We will then explore the popular utility program by Ola Hallengren and how to implement. Next, we will explore the other areas of SQL Server that need to be maintained like history tables in MSDB. Finally, we will explore the different options when maintenance windows are tight. 

At the end of this session you will be able to: (1) Choose a maintenance program for your SQL Servers; (2) Program and schedule the maintenance programs; (3) Ensure that the SQL Server is running at optimum performance each day.</p>

<h3>Power BI, from a DBA's Perspective</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Power BI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement Power BI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point Power BI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, Power BI, and how to make these work for you.</p>

<h3>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</p>

<h3>Querying Semistructured Data in Azure Data Lake with USQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.</p>

<h3>The Anatomy of Select</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Data Driven Subscriptions in SSRS Without Enterprise Edition</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Driven reports are a powerful Reporting Services feature, but they are only available in the Enterprise Edition.  In this session we're going to dig into the ReportServer database and look at some tables that will allow us to dynamically interact with subscription records and use them to control report output.
  
We will also leverage an SSRS interface to set and update parameters to the subscription tables.  
By using these techniques we can simulate the power of Data Driven Subscriptions without having to have Enterprise Edition.  These techniques can also be used to dynamically configure actual Data Driven Subscriptions and kick them off without access to the SQL Agent engine.  Anyone wanting to extend their SSRS capabilities in creating report automation should attend this session.</p>

<h3>Querying Temporal Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>System-versioned temporal tables, first introduced with SQL Server 2016, make it possible to not only query current data, but to also query the data as it was at a particular point in time. First, a temporal table is a type of table where the current version of the data is stored in the temporal table while previous versions of the data are stored in an associated “history” table. Together, the temporal table and its related history table store a full history of the data as it changes over time. Second, the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause is available in SELECT … FROM constructs for querying temporal tables at either a precise moment in time or during a specific period of time with one of four sub-clauses: AS OF, FROM TO, BETWEEN AND, and CONTAINED IN (,). In this presentation, the schema of a temporal table and its corresponding history table will be explored to gain an understanding of how SQL Server stores temporal data. This will be followed with queries demonstrating how and when to us</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a popular and powerful relational database system. It's easy to install with just a few clicks. Create a database, and you are in business. It will run great without much attention...until it doesn't. It's true that your shop may not have enough SQL Server instances to require a full time DBA, but SQL Server still needs some love and attention to perform its best. Attend this session to learn about knobs that need turning and more to get the most out of SQL Server.</p>
