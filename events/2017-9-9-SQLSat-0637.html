<h3>Who Needs Numbers? Patterns for Non-Numeric Measures in DAX</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Visualizations are wonderful, but they can be misinterpreted, and often, the space they occupy is disproportionate to the value they add. Enhance the functionality of your SSAS Tabular and Power BI output, by understanding HOW-, WHY- and WHEN to leverage the power of DAX to create text, date or Boolean measures.

We'll start the session by understanding what a Non-Numeric Measure is, and identifying situations in which they can be applied. Once we have that in place, we'll learn patterns for creating various Non-Numeric Measures and then we'll put our new knowledge to use by seeing Non-Numeric Measures in action, both in SSAS Tabular, and Power BI.</p>

<h3>PowerShell for SQL Server DBA - From Zero to Hero</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When starting out with PowerShell and SQL Server, it is hard to escape from the detail to work out the best strategy for creating scripts. IN In this session I will  explains how, when and why it pays to think in terms of versatile functions to meet varying demands.
How would you improve a PowerShell script in order to make it more versatile? How can you ensure that it is adaptable to the many similar tasks for which you are likely to need a script? In a nutshell, you turn into functions those common component tasks that you’ve written as scripts, and from these simple functions develop advanced functions. In doing so, you make the leap from PowerShell Zero to PowerShell Hero.   In this session , I’ll walk you through a practical example and demonstrate the steps along the way.</p>

<h3>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring i</p>

<h3>Why are there pirates and snakes in my SQL Server?</h3>

<h3>Optimizing Database Access And Diving Into .Net SqlClient</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The prevailing opinion is that the optimizations for SQL Server are usually only done on the server itself. But is there anything we can do on the client to gain more speed? Because there are always at least two sides of the performance coin, in this session aimed at .Net and SQL developers, we'll dive into the workings of the .Net SqlClient and give you insight into things like connection pools, transaction scopes, batch inserting, async data access and more.</p>

<h3>SQL Server and Application Security for Developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A lot of companies have a philosophy of "ship early with as many features as possible.” Security is an afterthought since it isn't fun to do and no one will attack them anyway. However, the dark side never sleeps, and security breaches have always happened, often leaving companies severely exposed or even bankrupt.
In this session we'll look at a few attack vectors that can be used against your company, and what you as a developer can and should do to protect against them. It will involve a good mix of security conscious SQL Server and application development, because you care about your work and nobody messes with you.</p>

<h3>Adaptive Query Plans? What’s up with that?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the new features announced for SQL Server 2017 is Adaptive Query Plans, query plans that can change after the query starts executing.

This session will show why this is a radical departure from the way that things have worked until now and how it can improve the performance of some query forms. We’ll look at the places where adaptive query plans work and compare the performance of queries using adaptive query plans to see just what kind of improvement it can make.</p>

<h3>Efficient and Effective coding of Stored Procedures</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>

<h3>Introduction to Database Design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Far too few database developers in this day and age get the opportunity to learn how to design relation databases.  In most cases, they will on occasion be asked to add a few objects to an existing system while following the standards of the organisation. These relatively infrequent changes do not hone the skills needed for effective design.

This session will go through the fundamentals of database design.  Topics such as normalization, Understanding Data Relationships as well as the Language of  Data Modeling and Design will be discussed. The Database Design Sequence Phases of Conceptual, Logical and Physical will be introduced as well.</p>

<h3>Normalization Beyond Third Normal Form</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you believe the myths that “Third Normal Form is good enough”, or that “Higher Normal Forms are hard to understand”?
Do you believe the people who claim that these statements are myths?
Or do you prefer to form your own opinion?
If you take database design seriously, you cannot afford to miss this session. You will get a clear and easy to understand overview of all the higher Normal Forms: what they are, how to check if they are met, and what consequences their violations can have. This will arm you with the knowledge to reject the myths about higher Normal Forms. But, more important: it will make you a better designer!</p>
