<h3>Implementing Supertypes and Subtypes in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A common problem in database design is the implementation of entities that are different physically (for instance, they share some attributes but have additional, specific, attributes), but should logically participate in the same relationships as one and the same.
For instance, the customer can either be a natural person (a person, for short), or a legal person (an organization or a company). The majority of the attributes of a natural person are, of course, different from the majority of the attributes of a legal person; however, from the perspective of how they participate in business operations, they need to be considered as equal.
In this session you will learn how to use specific native SQL Server functionalities to solve this particular problem: sparse columns, XML, JSON, and/or even User-defined CLR types – in an OLTP database, as well as in a star (or snowflake) schema data warehouse.</p>

<h3>Power BI loves AI and Azure AI Services</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI - Microsoft's favorite analytics tool has played a very significant role in spreading data driven culture among organizations. From the beginning Power BI was enhanced with many AI techniques, and plays a vital role in Microsoft's recent mission on "Democratizing AI".
In my demo heavy presentation I will give a minimal overview on Power BI and Power BI Premium to give a context, and after it we will examine how AI is infused into PowerBI helping analysts became more productive in discovering hidden gems with functionality as of today from QA, Quick Insight, Explain differences etc. to R and Python integration
In the second part of the presentation we will overview and try Microsoft's recent announcement arount integrating more deeply AI/ML into the product with functionalities like Automated ML, Azure ML integration and Azure Cognitive Services integration.</p>

<h3>Power BI as a universal analytic tool 1/2</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In Power BI, you can also do other kinds of analyses than just business analytics. In this lecture you’ll see, how you can use Power BI together with cloud services for quick check of facts from freely available data sources, even if they aren’t published in a particularly suitable format. You will also see, how you can quickly analyze unstructured text (e.g. communication with customers). At the end we will take a look at PowerApps, using which you can not only quickly create a new business app in your web browser, but also integrate it in your Power BI reports, so that you can quickly react to results and take action from a single environment. Because Power BI is capable of doing much more than “just” business analyses.</p>

<h3>How to choose the right data model: SQL Server or Azure Cosmos DB. Which, When and Where ?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing a database, always there are considerations about picking a relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL) data structure. While both are viable options, there are certain key differences between these two options that users must keep in mind.This session will cover the most important distinctions and will make a difference between two of a key players in the Microsoft database world: SQL Server and Azure Cosmos DB.  The session will also illustrate some of the fundamental differences between these databases - the language, scalability and structure which cause this distinctions to have  implications for the right choice.So which database is right for your business the attendance will take informations in this session.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Azure Data Lake</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure Data Lake is an umbrella term consisting of multiple Azure services. As the name implies, these services are built for big data processing purposes. During this session, you will gain the understanding of which service to use and when - as well as when not to use. My aim is to deliver the fundamentals around the topic so that you can feel comfortable before your first dive into the Lake. I will also do demos using the latest and greatest services.</p>

<h3>A Masters view on Locking and blocking</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do the wait stats show you that you have a locking issue?
This session will show you how to detect and view blocking and lock waits, and understand the cause of it.
An extensive walkthrough of the different isolation levels and their respective benefits and drawbacks.
And finally a real-world quick list of suggestions on what you can do to solve some of the common issues I come across in my daily work.</p>

<h3>MS SQL New functions, syntaxes, tips  tricks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Maybe you are still using some old MS SQL database engine and you are unsure why you should upgrade to 2016 or newer versions? 
In this session we will see what bring us some newly introduced MS SQL functions and syntaxes like COMPRESS, STRING_SPLIT, STRING_AGG, DROP IF EXISTS (a.k.a. DIE) and many more. How are they performing compared to some old solutions? 
Accompanied with multiple examples, this session will show you many interesting topics.</p>
