<h3>The Hitchhiker's Guide to navigating Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Are you also sometimes lost in space? What is up and what is down, when it comes to navigation in Power BI. How much is controlled and what can you adjust yourself?

This session will cover all the options we have to change and setup navigation on three different levels. (1) Inside Reports, (2) between Reports in an App and finally (3) the Power BI Web Portal to help users finding the Apps and Reports. You will be amazed how much actually can be done, to give your users a better experience.

We will cover topics like, Power BI Service navigation, Linking from an Intranet, Setting up Dashboards, The new App navigation, Drillthrough, Buttons, Bookmarks and much more.</p>

<h3>Data Modeling Solutions for Challenging BI Data Modeling Problems</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Sorry to break the news but the world is not flat and neither is business data. Data modeling is an essential skill in Power BI design and hard problems require creative solutions. In this session, we will enumerate common challenges and demonstrate modeling techniques to resolve them. Session topics: implementing star and snowflake schema essentials, role-playing tables, many-to-many and bi-directional filters, working without relationships, disconnected lookup tables and calculation groups. We will also discuss the composite models and the future of BI data modeling.</p>

<h3>Debugging without debugger: investigating SQL Server’s internal structures</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to know exactly how SQL Server stores data for temporary structures, such as for instance the spooled data in a Table Spool or Index Spool operator? No? I don’t blame you. It’s a bit like wanting to know who watered the rubber tree that produced the rubber your tires are made off before you get in the car to drive to work. You really don’t need it.
But you might still WANT to know. I did. And I figured it out.
Without ever touching the debugger (I’m a simple soul, that stuff is much too complex for me!), I figured out how I could look at the exact storage structures SQL Server creates and uses to store data in Table Spool and Index Spool operators.
If you are willing to commit to a fast-paced and deep internals session that is guaranteed to teach you exactly zero actually useful information, then this is the session for you.</p>

<h3>2 Fast 2 Furious - designing for speed, concurrency, and correctness</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the multitude of isolation levels, concurrency models, and specialist technologies available in SQL Server, it is no surprise that transaction throughput and correctness can be directly correlated to the ability and knowledge of the person that wrote the code.

In this session, we will reveal how SQL Server concurrency and correctness often goes wrong, how we can avoid this, and how we can use our knowledge to design and develop for optimal server throughput for our applications and processes using tips and tricks gained from real-world scenarios.

We will cover SQL Server’s traditional locking model, In-Memory OLTP, Columnstore, Delayed Durability, and many other technologies and techniques you can use to make your transactions more robust.</p>

<h3>Poor man's SQL Server job monitoring with R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Of course SQL Server (Management or Azure Data Studio) offers you a list view of the agent job history. But wouldn't it be nice to have a graphical overview of job durations and how they develop?

This session is for DBAs and R newbies alike: In one hour we'll develop a dashboard-like overview of your agent jobs' and their durations with the R language.

We'll work our way from finding the right system tables to use, generating one graph per job with the help of R, to adding that little trend line to every one of them. After creating it in RStudio, we'll eventually adapt our script to run in SSMS/ADS just as fine. Once finished, no additional tools are needed, no additional €€ spent.</p>

<h3>When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most modern programming environments offers exception handling in some form, and SQL Server provides the popular TRY-CATCH concept. However, error handling in SQL Server is not as straightforward as one may wish, but it is marred with inconsistencies and surprises. This session starts off by displaying the some of the surprises you can encounter, both when you use TRY-CATCH and when you don't.

The session presents a recipe for writing CATCH block where focus is on keeping things simple and you will learn why it is not a good idea to make your error handling "fancy", although it may seem to be a good idea in theory. The session also covers a few things to think of on client level.</p>

<h3>Common Data Model - Our new buddy for Data Governance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Common Data Model as the foundation of Power BI Dataflows and as part of the Open Data Initiative with SAP and Adobe, seems to be a pretty good move from Microsoft. We want to take a closer look to this approach. In this session we show how the Common Data Model will allow you to combine Self-Service ETL and Corporate Data Engineering. We will show you how Power BI and more specialised tools like ADF, DataBricks etc. can work together on the Azure Data Lake with one common model. We than extend this and show, what opportunities this standard brings to you, when we unleash the possibilities you have on managing Data Quality and Governance. We also will have a look in how you integrate CDM in a DataOps  Methodology.</p>

<h3>Why Partitioning can boost your data management</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Partitioning is a great feature of SQL Server and since SQL 2016 you can use it in Standard Edition, too. See in this session the benefits of partitioning for ETL, maintenance and backup / restore.
The main area of application for partitioning is the optimization of load paths for complex DWH solutions and maintenance of large databases (statistics, indexes, backup, restore).After a brief introduction to partitioning, this session will focus on the key benefits of the above topics</p>

<h3>"DAX" the way to do it</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, you just can't ignore DAX, the amazing language of Power BI. In this session, I'll show you it's true power and how knowing it can even make you completely rethink your data models.
No more hundreds of columns and weird aggregations in the database. With the Power of DAX, you can now achieve much more sophisticated and powerful calculations, while keeping it simple at its core.
I'll show you real-world applications of DAX and lots of tips and tricks that you will be able to use quickly and with little effort!</p>

<h3>From XL to S - Reduce your Power BI model size by 90%!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what makes Power BI so fast and powerful when it comes to performance? So powerful, that it performs complex calculations over millions of rows in a blink of an eye.

In this session, we will dig deep to discover what is “under the hood” of Power BI, how your data is being stored, compressed, queried, and finally, brought back to your report. After the session, you will get a better understanding of the hard work happening in the background and appreciate the importance of creating an optimal data model in order to get maximum performance from the Power BI engine.

Finally, you will see a real use-case demo showing how the Power BI data model was reduced by 90%!</p>

<h3>Azure Key Vault, Azure Dev Ops and Data Factory how do these Azur</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Can we store our Connectionstrings or BlobStorageKeys or other Secretvalues somewhere else then in Azure Data Factory(ADF)? Yes you can! You can store these valuable secrets in Azure Key Vault(AKV).
But how can we achieve this in ADF? And finally how do we deploy our DataFactories in Azure Dev Ops to Test, Acceptance and Production environments with these Secrets ? Can this be setup dynamically?
During this session I will give answers on all of these questions. You will learn how to setup your Azure Key Vault, connect these secrets in ADF and finally deploy these secrets dynamically in Azure Dev Ops. As you can see a lot to talk about during this session.</p>

<h3>Baking Extended Events recipes without breaking a sweat</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>OK, you got the message: Extended Events is the way to monitor SQL Server from now on. However, you feel overwhelmed by XML shredding and the simplest of tasks seems impossible. 
Fear not: in this demo intensive session I will show you how to tackle the most challenging tasks without writing a single line of code. I will use the open-source tool XESmartTarget to audit logins, find unused objects, capture and notify deadlocks and much more.
Stop doing things the hard way! Join me and learn how XESmartTarget can do all the heavy lifting for you.</p>

<h3>Automating the testing of your BI solutions with NBi</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you want to accelerate the testing of your BI solutions, the best strategy is the automation of your tests with the help of a dedicated framework. During this session, we’ll take a look to the features of the open-source framework named “NBi” (www.nbi.io). This framework is providing support for automated tests on the fields of databases, cubes, reports and ETLs, without the need of .Net skills. The demos will show us the best approaches to quickly and effectively assert the quality of BI developments. We'll go a step further, generating the tests by an interesting system of templates and test-cases sources.</p>

<h3>Designing impactful visualisations for your data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As Data is key, visualising said data is even more important. We want our message to be understood with ease, and merely with a couple of glances. Hence making sure the receiving party can do so with ease will be vital to our success.

During this session, we'll go through some steps on how to maximise the potential of data visualisations. Starting at choosing the right types of visualisations, and which colour palettes are good matches for your message, we'll also make sure that our designs are as inclusive as we can possibly make them. Wrapping up with a few common use cases, you’ll definitely pick up a few new things to take home with you.

Walking out of this session, you can expect to have a decent understanding on a few common design principles for your data visualisations and reports.</p>

<h3>Connect your data artifacts with Azure Synapse Analytics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In human brains, synapses are responsible to connect information pieces together. Over time, our knowledge increases when more and more synapses are connected together. Following that analogy, Azure Synapse Analytics wants to connect (all) information silos together and provide a single point of analytics. 
Join this session, if you want to hear about the building blocks of Azure Synapse Analytics, how Data Engineers and Data Scientists and even BI developer can work together in a single service and see how easy it is to start with Synapse Analytics!</p>

</h3>
<p>Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…</p>

<p>I've started with SQL Server 6.5 but only as a sys-admin and not as DBA. Later I'd worked as a full DBA with SQL Server 2000 and my love to SQL Server started. In 2015  I'd got more interested in SQL PASS and tried to speak for the first time... the main part of my job is to work as DB-Admin and solution architect but I'm trying to widen my horizons. In 2016 I've visited and volunteered at the German SQL Saturdays und SQLGrillen and since October 2016 I'm the organizer of Azure Meetup Hamburg.</p>
