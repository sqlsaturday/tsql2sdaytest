<h3>XML and Relational Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using established relational database principles can help us decide when and how to use the XML feature in SQL Server 2005 / 2008.

Contrary to typical technology presentations, this focuses on what we _should_ do over just a list of features and their syntax. The audience will learn what's missing from the typical understanding of "first normal form," how a correct understanding helps guide design decisions, and how to apply this to the design of databases where XML or other complex types are</p>

<h3>SSIS Tips  Tricks</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Integration Services is an essential part of a company's data process.  Used for ETL and control flow, SSIS can be a boon for many enterprise solutions.  Because this product offers such a steep learning curve for the uninitiated, take advantage of my experience by hearing some tips to get the most out of your packages.  This session will offer tips for both SSIS 2005 and show some new features of SSIS 2008.</p>

<h3>Business Intelligence</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We will elaborate on our successful implementations of business intelligence in the private sector and in the government arena.   We can share our challenges and successes on a couple different ETL (Extract Transform Load) approaches, data staging, data marts, creating Cubes and reporting and analysis.   

The technology we will cover is SQL Server 2005 and how we leveraged (SSAS) SQL Server Analysis Services (SSIS) SQL Server Integration Services and browsing with Excel 2007 to help drive dec</p>

<h3>Gaining SQL Server Insight with DMV's</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will explore SQL Server 2005 DMV's.  During this session will explore what DMV's are, and how they can be used to obtain information that SQL Server has collected about your SQL Server environment.  Thing we will explore is how to identify indexes that have not been used, or indexes that SQL Server has identified that are missing.  Other thing we will explore is how to use DMV's to identify your most expensive queries by CPU, I/O and elpased time.</p>

<h3>Building Reports in SQL Server Reporting Services </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Using SQL Server Reporting Services can simplify designing reports, but how do you handle complex report requirements?  This session will discuss how to handle these complex scenarios by using the new features of SSRS 2008.  We will walk through building reports to showcase these situations.  This session will be friendly to people who have experience in either SSRS 2005 or SSRS 2008.</p>

<p>Table partitioning can be a very way to manage very large tables and their indexes. In this presentation, you will learn about the practical issues of table partitoning, including choosing range direction, schema file placement, sliding and revolving windows, and partitioned indexed views. Partitioning features of both SQL Server 2008 and 2005 will be covered, and typical usage of the partiton-related DMVs and DMFs illustrated.</p>

<h3>Introduction to SQL Server Hints</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most of the time, the SQL Server query optimizer does a great job of selecting an optimal query plan. On a rare occasion it does not, and when it does not, then hints are sometimes needed to help the query optimizer create an optimal query plan. In this session we will:

•	Learn when to use, and not to use hints
•	Learn how to implement commonly used hints
•	Learn hint best practices

<h3>Long parameter lists</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Newbies coming from procedural languages whose procedures and functions allow non-scalar (i.e. non-1NF) parameters try to mimic familiar constructs in SQL by writing parsers for character strings or using proprietary XML extensions. The result is that they immediately lose all the power of declarative coding, parameter validation and performance.  Then the maintenance of the code becomes a problem. 

SQL Server cam easily handle a long list of parameters.  The code is not only safer but easy t</p>
