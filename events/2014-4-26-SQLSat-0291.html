<h3>Business Continuity: The Real Reason for HA and DR</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>These days, I've stopped counting how many times I've been approached to help implement feature X because a customer thinks/was told it provides 24x7 for a DB/instance. These decisions often lead to more downtime and less uptme if the technology choice was not right or cannot be administered by the current staff. The secret sauce is not what gets implemented but understanding everything behind the scenes that influences the final architecture based on your actual requirements. It’s less about technology and more about understanding what it will take to keep your business going even when things seems like they are crumbling down around you. This session will cover how to approach achieving business continuity with the right amount of uptime.</p>

<h3>Query Tuning Mastery: Clash of the Row Goals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The fight for better performance is a battle of wits: your mind, your intelligence, and your honor pitted against the less-than-dependable whims of the Query Optimizer. But alas, the arbitrary rewrites and clunky hints leveraged by most developers to get around optimization deficiencies make things feel less like a proper duel and more like a skirmish at the sandbox. To truly engage your enemy you must comprehend his inner workings, and in the case of the Query Optimizer, that means you must delve into the mysteries of "row goals." These internal metrics are tracked and enforced within Top iterators--and they exhibit a considerable amount of influence over plan shape and flow, both at compile time and as your query runs. Attend this session to learn how to take charge of optimization, expertly mold your query plans, and gain a new set of tools for eliminating bottlenecks in even your most complex problem queries. En garde!</p>

<h3>DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.</p>

<h3>How to Think Like the Engine</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You’re a developer or a DBA, and you’re comfortable writing queries to get the data you need. You’re much less comfortable trying to design the right indexes for your database server. In this session with Microsoft Certified Master Brent Ozar, you’ll role play as the database engine while Brent gives you queries. You’ll learn first-hand about clustered indexes, nonclustered indexes, execution plans, sargability, statistics, TempDB spills, and T-SQL anti-patterns.</p>

<h3>Database Development using SQL Server Data Tools</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In 2007, Microsoft introduced Data Dude for Visual Studio 2005 to help bring the processes, controls and tools for code management to Database Development that Application developers had been enjoying for ages.  It had its problems, but it mostly worked and was a welcome step in the right direction. Many versions later we have SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2013 (and 2012 and 2010...). A more mature product that finally brings database development up to par with traditional application development and has many features data geeks, like ourselves, will truly love. This talk will provide an overview of SSDT’s features and show you how to get started using it to save time, implement better code controls and be a better DBA or database developer.</p>

<h3>Choose Your Geospatial Mapping Adventure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You have geospatial data and you know that plotting it on a map will deliver insights. Or maybe you keep hearing “geospatial” as a current BI buzzword and you want to be informed about your options when you get to it. The Microsoft BI stack provides several options for visualizing location data. But how do you know which tool will best serve your purpose, or what factors are important in making this decision? We’ll identify factors to consider when choosing a tool to visualize your data in maps such as system requirements, availability and type of location data, required level of technical understanding, and more. You’ll leave the session confident in your ability to choose the best tool within Excel and SQL Server.</p>

<h3>How to properly gather performance counter data using Windows PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We DBA´s know how important it is to collect performance data. In this session, I will show to you how to properly use the native Get-Counter PowerShell cmdlet to get all information you need from your servers. It has never been as easy to collect performance counter data and save it to a CSV file or a SQL Server table for baselining and later analysis. You may be thinking "But I don’t know nothing about PowerShell and explicitly using .NET classes in my code". Don’t worry; you don’t need to know this to collect counters. Although this is a 100-level session, you’ll be producing 400-level results and your scripts will scale as the number of servers increase, because we’ll use asynchronous collection and processing. And better yet, we’ll schedule all of it. All this using native PowerShell cmdlets and a minimal amount of script code.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Features That Will Blow Your Mind!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How many lines of code does it take to generate a running total?  How would you find a value in the next row of data - without using a cursor or loop?  How can you efficiently store rows of data with a lot of optional fields, and how can you quickly find which of those rows have values?  And how can you eliminate locking without resorting to dirty reads?  SQL Server has answers for all of these questions, and none requires more than a few lines of code.  Give me an hour, and I will blow your mind!</p>

<h3>Extending SQL Server with Advanced Analytics and R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Microsoft SQL Server stack provides an excellent set of tools for storing, visualizing, and analyzing data, but sometimes we want to do more. In this session, we’ll take a look at the open-source statistical software R and how we can use it to connect to SQL Server, analyze data, and put the results of our analysis back into SQL Server for later use. We’ll look at examples of analyses performed by a fictional company as they segment their customers, forecast their sales, and examine interesting relationships among their product offerings. Along the way, we’ll see what some of these analyses would take if done in SQL Server itself and why R is so effective when paired with SQL Server.</p>

<h3>Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.</p>

<h3>Forward the Federations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you are working with Windows Azure SQL Database (WASD) then you know that the way to scale large data sets is to use federations. If you were using SSIS to move data into a federated database you know how challenging this can be. This year Microsoft released a new SSIS component that handles a lot of the federated headache. I'll give the steps you need to set up federations in your WASD database and how to use SSIS to fill the tables with data. </p>

<h3>Eureka! Visual deep dive into storage internals</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Sometimes half the battle in computing is just to see what's happening. We will take a visual tour of physical database storage structures, using live demos with the freeware application SQL Server File Layout Viewer and our old friends the DBCC commands as guides. See what happens in a data file when you convert a table from a heap to a clustered index! See fragmentation and the havoc wrought by Shrink! Marvel at the behavior of multiple files and filegroups! Index Rebuilds! Eureka!</p>
