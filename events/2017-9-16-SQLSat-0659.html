<h3>An introduction to Data Mining  with SQL Server 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.</p>

<h3>Shedding some light on Windowing Functions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Windowing functions in T-SQL add power and speed to your queries, and have myriad uses in all types of situations.

Songs by The Beatles spent a combined 585 weeks on the Top 100 Billboard Chart.

In this session, we'll combine these unlikely bedfellows, by using The Beatles' chart data to gain an in-depth knowledge of Windowing Functions in T-SQL. Learn the theory behind each clause in the Windowing Functions and immediately see it applied in both an abstract, and concrete, way.  Learn how Windowing Functions can help you enhance your queries, and solve complex problems quickly and easily. From running totals, to lag and lead queries, Windowing Functions will help you deliver high quality information in no time. Once you've seen the power of these functions, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them. Understanding Windowing Functions may seem like a "Long and Winding Road", but "Come Together" and walk away with a skill that you'll use "Here, There and Everywhere".</p>

<h3>Parameter sniffing and other cases of the confused optimiser</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The SQL Server query optimiser is incredibly good at its job. It can generate good, fast execution plans for 1 row, three table OLTP queries and 1 billion row, all the tables analytics queries and just about everything in between.

But it’s not perfect, and there are query patterns that will send the optimiser for a complete loop and the query execution times through the roof.

We’re going to look at the more common of those query patterns and see exactly what it is about them that causes problems. We’ll spend some time on ways of identifying such queries in production and we’ll look at a variety of ways to write the queries so that they work with the optimiser, not against it. 

Along the way you’ll learn enough about the behaviour of the optimiser to be able to identify other problematic query forms before they cause problems.</p>

<h3>Jump Start Into SQL Development</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What does a SQL Developer do? This presentation will be targeting Entry level developers to give a basic understanding of SQL and its day to day uses.

We will be taking you through a few key concepts along with practical examples:
1. Basic SQL
2. Best Practices
3. Optimizing a Badly Performing Query</p>

<h3>Exploring Twitter Campaigns, Facebook and Google Analytics data in PowerBI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Social Media data can be very powerful in growing your business, however this is BigData and not many companies know how to consume it and get the most benefit out of it. PowerBI has great features that allow you to use their templates to explore the data and get the most value out of it to make your marketing decisions. There will be a demo on how to set up a PowerBI Twitter Campaign, Facebook and Google Analytics dashboards and how to get value out of them.</p>

<h3>What is a Database?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What is a database actually? What does SQL give you out of the box? How is data actually stored? What is a page, what is a log, what does 'Hardening to disk' actually mean? Are there only 4 commands in a database?

This session is designed to give a respectful nod to all the things you "Get for free" when working on a Database.</p>

<h3>Real World Example of Using R in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session we look at how R in SQL Server can be used in a production environment to automatically run models against data coming into SQL Server, as well as update the model with no interference from the data scientist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Transactions...because ACID can save you</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether we're aware of it or not, Transactions are used in all our SQL code.
Let's take a dive into the details and see how we can use Transactions to code defensively and efficiently, and look at gotchas like what does a nested transaction actually mean.</p>

<h3>Get started with R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session will walk through getting started with Microsoft Open R and Visual Studio.
We'll cover reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, and organizing and commenting R code.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Database Design</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Far too few database developers in this day and age get the opportunity to learn how to design relation databases.  In most cases, they will on occasion be asked to add a few objects to an existing system while following the standards of the organisation. These relatively infrequent changes do not hone the skills needed for effective design.</p>

<h3>Data without technology</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this interactive session we will discuss what and who to take into consideration when thinking about a data strategy</p>

<h3>Getting started with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>PowerBI is a powerful suite of tools that enables any user to create and share stunning reports. In this session, you will learn how easily stunning reports can be created and shared with just a few clicks of your mouse. 

You will learn how PowerBI can connect to data that exists on-premise as well as in the cloud. that data can then be cleansed, transformed and then modelled to allow the discovery of powerful new insights that can then easily be shared with colleagues and clients. Finally, we will discuss the licencing model behind PowerBI which ranges from the free Desktop tool through to Premium licencing options.</p>

<h3>A Lap Around New Developer Features in SQL Server 2017</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>By the time of me writing this, SQL Server 2017 is out as Community Technical Preview's and the it shows some very interesting new functionality. In this session we will have a quick look at what is new in SQL Server 2017 from a developers perspective.</p>

<h3>Efficient and Effective coding of Stored Procedures</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data does not become information until decision makers are able to view it and make those decisions that affect the enterprise as a whole. Stored procedures are one means of getting the data from the database tables to the reports in an effective and efficient manner.
In this hands-on presentation, we shall be looking at best practices with regards to creating and tuning stored procedures. We shall also be discussing parameter sniffing and other gotcha’s that affect us in our daily lives.</p>

<h3>Adaptive Query Plans? What’s up with that?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the new features announced for SQL Server 2017 is Adaptive Query Plans, query plans that can change after the query starts executing.

This session will show why this is a radical departure from the way that things have worked until now and how it can improve the performance of some query forms. We’ll look at the places where adaptive query plans work and compare the performance of queries using adaptive query plans to see just what kind of improvement it can make.</p>

<h3>Docker => Containers => Service Fabric => SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are a lot of buzzwords being through around the last few years in the development space... Things like "containers", "Docker", "Service Fabric" and the sorts.

In this session we will look at what these various pieces of software are, what they are are good at and how work really well with SQL Server v.Next (2017) to give you exceptional availability for your data store.</p>
