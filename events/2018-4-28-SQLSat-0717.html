<h3>Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Azure SQL Database offers a way quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.</p>

<h3>SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.</p>

<h3>45 Minutes to Your First SSAS Tabular Model</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the new Azure Analysis Services product? Or you've looked at these and like what they can add in Power BI or classic BI scenarios, but haven't had a chance to dive in and figure all of this out? Now is the time!
SSAS Tabular is a new-ish form of business intelligence model released with SQL Server 2012, intended as an alternative to more traditional Multidimensional cubes. In this session, we will talk briefly about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various options for deployment, before exploring the development process of creating a tabular model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.</p>

<h3>45 min to build your first SSRS report</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Does this sound like you? You've been BI curious and now you've been given access to SSRS and you want to make a report. Or, you're a DBA or DBA Dev and could use a report to reduce daily task. Either way, I've got your back! You will learn everything you need to know to get that first report out the door quickly and how to tweak it once it’s deployed.  We’ll use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) 2016. The query makes no difference, this time it's all about the output.</p>

<h3>Eliminating the CRUD with Entity Framework Core</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Developers need to insert and query data stored in databases, but never want to enter the land of building SQL stored procedures for everything. I want to give an approach to CRUD without caring about the underlying database container. We're .NET Developers, we like to write structures in a way that makes sense to us. In this case, Entity Framework Core is a brilliant option that layers on top of MySQL, Postgres SQL, and MS SQL, to name a few.</p>

<h3>Working Effectively With Legacy SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A legacy code base can be a frightening thing.  Between strict deadlines, ever-evolving requirements, differing skill levels of contributors over time, and historical circumstances, keeping database code clean and concise is difficult at best.  This example- and demo-driven talk will help you build out a mental framework to prune those gnarled code bases.  Much of this talk will be familiar to software developers who know of the "clean code" philosophy, but no knowledge of the topic is necessary.  If you shudder whenever you look at your SQL code base, this talk may be for you.</p>

<h3>Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and concurrency you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.</p>

<h3>SSIS Incremental Loading:  The Tortoise and The Hare</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Extracting, transforming and loading data has become a major component to satisfying business requirements and needs.  Depending on the size of the data you are working with, the way you design your SSIS packages can have an impact on performance and run times.  

In this session, we will cover a variety of incremental design approaches centered around large data sets using SSIS.  We will look at the architecture of each ETL strategy to determine the pros and cons and generate specific use cases to decide which strategy yields optimal results.</p>

<h3>Handcrafting Covering Indexes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have a need for speed but cannot change the code? Covering indexes might be your best friend. You might have heard about covering indexes, but what are they exactly and how do you design one? In this session, we explore what covering indexes are, why you might or might not need one, how to craft them, and how to test them for effectiveness. By the end of the session, you will be prepared to make effective indexing decisions while tuning individual queries.</p>

After a few years with the State as an applications developer, the manager of Systems Programming decided it would be better to have me on the inside looking out rather than on the outside trying to get in. I spent the next 14 years as a mainframe system programmer for two state agencies. In 1996 I moved to Healthcare IT and have been that ever since. I’ve spent most of the past 14 years doing ETL, performance and HIPAA security.
