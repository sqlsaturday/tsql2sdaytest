<h3>Possible Musics:  SSAS Multidimensional vs Tabular</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI. BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server. Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with SSAS 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths. In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features. He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.</p>

<h3>Excel 2013 Tips and Tricks for Displaying a Multidimensional Cube</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>New features have been added to the last couple of Excel releases in order to bring the most used desktop reporting application to a full-featured Business Intelligence reporting tool for Multidimensional Cubes. This session will be filled with demonstration of all these new features with slides only as references to more detailed explanations and uses. Pivot Tables will be the main focus of this 75-minute session with visual tools that enhance graphs and dashboards.

You will leave this session with your brain firing on all cylinders to create cool dashboards with color enhanced backgrounds to signal to users where they should focus their efforts. The new Timeline object makes you breathe a sigh of relief about report filtering by dates. Slicers will give you clues of what data is present. Indicators, data-driven formatting, and spark lines focus attention on what is important to the viewed data set. </p>

<h3>PS C:\gt; Get-Started -With 'PowerShell Desired State Configuration'</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this day and age, with the virtualization of servers causing systems in your datacenter to multiply faster than rabbits on Viagra, how do you perform configuration management on all of those systems and the software that they run while operating on a shoestring budget? How do you detect and remediate configuration drift to stay in compliance with your organization’s standards? During this session, PowerShell MVP and scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate how DSC (Desired State Configuration) can be used to perform configuration management of your systems. DSC is a new management platform in PowerShell which was introduced with WMF 4.0 that allows for the declarative configuration of systems. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.</p>

<h3>The Ticking Timebombs in Your Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've worked hard to build the best systems you can, and then one night you get called in to resolve a production incident.  As you peer into your database, you see it: something so bad it sends shivers down your spine.  How did that get in there?  Who did that? Why? And how do you fix it?

In this session, we look at the workarounds, technical debt and clever designs that can cause you grief when you least expect it.  We will also include perfectly fine features that can haunt you later. We will discuss how these things happen and give you tools to identify the ones that cause the most pain.

Join us: you'll keep your job, have happier users and get more rest.

<h3>Beauty and the Bits:  Why both Left and Right Brain MUST be Engaged</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you plan to run your own consulting business, be a freelancer, or be a healthy part of a software or design team you will need to understand the importance of engaging both your left- and right-brain in the future.

Just as manufacturing automation put much of the "human back" out of business in the Industrial Age, certain forces threaten to put the "human brain" out of business in the age to come. This talk will prepare you for its arrival and insulate you for its duration. Learn how to recognize and utilize the value of well-rounded thinking as you progress throughout your career.</p>

<h3>Exploring Your SQL Server Databases with T-SQL</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a DBA and performance tuning consultant, for Ambient Consulting in Minneapolis, I'm often asked to analyze performance issues on a SQL Server instance with which I'm unfamiliar. It can be a daunting task. Let's face it, most of the time companies do not have good documentation about their databases. Or if they do, it is outdated, or it takes a few days to locate and retrieve it.

In this present, I share a set of basic scripts that I've developed, over the years, which mine the metadata in the various system functions, stored procedures, tables, catalog views, and dynamic management views, Together, they reveal all the secrets of the databases on the instance, their size, file locations, and their design, including columns, data types, defaults, keys and indexes.  You will walk away with 40 scripts to reverse engineer a database
