<h3>An introduction to Data Mining</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the vast amount of changes that occur in our daily business environments, it becomes more and more difficult to achieve our corporate goals without some ‘lighthouse’ to guide our way. Data mining, (while not a panacea to resolve or ‘control’ the effects of these changes), can provide us with statistical trends by analyzing our data and highlighting probable outcomes.

In this hands on BEGINNERS presentation we shall be looking at Microsoft SQL Server’s Data Mining capabilities and we shall be discussing:

1)  Defining what questions we want answered and how to go about this in an effective and efficient manner.

2)  Creating the data model.

3)  How to gather the necessary data, discussing the training and testing aspect.

4)  Processing the model.

5)  Extracting information from our finished model, discussing the implications of this information.</p>

<h3>Pragmatic Power BI:  Working with Data Sources</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI (either Desktop or the service) supports a wide (and growing) range of data sources.  From the sources with which most IT pros and data analysts are regularly involved (relational and OLAP databases, text and similar files, etc.) to sources that are a little more out of the ordinary for some of us (OData, MS Exchange, Active Directory, and a growing list of others), these reservoirs and suppliers of data grow increasingly more valuable in self-service BI.  
In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson focuses upon the first step in working with data sources in Power BI:  connecting to, and extracting data from, a diverse range of data sources. Throughout the session, we explore various sources and witness how to employ Power BI with each.

<h3>SQL Server Agent : All the Knobs You Need to Know</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>As a production DBA, do you struggle to schedule heavy jobs to avoid times when the server is already overloaded? Have you ever felt like your end users notice data corruption, blocked processes, or a full tempdb even before you do? And have you ever been frustrated by the fact that Agent never stores quite enough job history to help you troubleshoot job failures? The fact is, SQL Server Agent can do way more than just schedule jobs at a fixed time.  In this session you'll learn how to make SQL Agent run jobs only when ample CPU resources are available, how you can be the first to get notified when data corruption has occurred, and how to use Agent for monitoring data file size issues. You will also walk away with a set of scripts that will help you customize job history retention.  By the end of this demo rich session you will understand how to leverage SQL Agent’s hidden gems that will make your database management job more efficient without requiring additional development time.  </p>

<h3>Virtual SQL Servers, Actual Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 

This session is packed with many tips and tricks for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance are discussed, and the knowledge gained can help you work with your infrastructure engineers so that you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes are demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.</p>

<h3>Version control with GIT for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. In that same note, github, the most popular service for hosting git repositories has become so ubiquitous that Microsoft chose to host the source code for its OSS fork of the .NET framework there instead of its own codeplex.

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
How do I fork a SVN repo to github?

We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.</p>

<h3>100 Times Faster: Experiences making SQL Server go Fast</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How do you go about making a program run a lot faster!  Like 100 times faster?   It’s difficult.  Microsoft tried in the Hekaton project, its in-memory tables feature of SQL 2014, and they got close.  Inspired by that effort, this presentation looks at some recent cases where I’ve been able to achieve huge performance improvements in SQL Server code and how that happens.

When I work on SQL Server performance I emphasize that the first thing to think about is how to accomplish the task in a different way that will be much faster”.   Sometimes there’s a better algorithm.  Sometimes a different technology is more appropriate.  Sometimes it’s a combination of many changes that combine to create the desired outcome much, much faster. 

This presentation is illustrated with examples from my work and we'll look for common threads that might help us all.</p>

<h3>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. Here you’ll learn: • The most useful regular expression commands. • The appropriate times to use regular expressions. • How to use regular expressions to write code for you. • How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods. </p>

<h3>Architecting Availability Groups</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You are a DBA familiar with some basic Windows clustering and database mirroring concepts, and now you are considering AlwaysOn Availability Groups. This session will cover the pros and cons of four typical configurations of AlwaysOn Availability Groups; stand-alone instances, fail-over cluster instances, multi-subnet, and a hybrid approach that I call disaster-recovery-on-the-cheap. It will also include their exclusive features such as read-only routing and backup off-loading. In addition, you'll learn how to use the Availability Group Listener correctly and why you should be using Windows Server 2012 R2 or above, along with some of my own personal lessons learned.</p>

<h3>Rewriting Your Checklist for SQL 2016</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How big should the page file be for Windows Server 2016? How many data files should SQL Server 2016's TempDB contain? What trace flags should we use by default now?
 
These are questions you addressed long ago in your setup checklist. You've spent a lot of time with that checklist, and you're sure it's perfect. Or is it? When was the last time you visited that checklist?  Does it make sense for SQL 2014? What about SQL 2016? Change is hard, and DBAs need to constantly challenge yesterday's best practices to ensure they meet today's business needs.
 
Join Microsoft MVP Mike Hillwig and his list of server administration best practices that need to be revisited for modern versions of SQL Server, especially SQL 2016.</p>

<h3>DataSets, Making the Perfect DataSet Efficient in SQL Server 2016!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>I will teach you the world of making DataSets. The use of T-SQL in SQL Server provides many ways to utilize the data you already have.
In this 60 minute session we will go through the progression of useful techniques to manipulate a record set.
Whether you use tables,temp tables, CTE's and/or Table variables, we will find the right situation for each one.
We will also take a look at 2016's SQL Server's new Columnstore indexes on temp tables if and when they are useful.

Trying to get that impossible result set for that report or extract, then please make it to this intermidiate session on how to resolve your dataset woes!

<h3>Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Being able to group data into logical and meaningful sets can be extremely useful.  When the data involved is a non-repeating sequence of integers, grouping is not too difficult.  Most real data, though, is made up of dates, times, decimals, and rarely can guarantee non-repeating, non-null data sets.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data.  Want to know how many production incidents make up a single common problem?  Can we track sales success by the number of  consecutive weeks that an agent has exceeded their goal?  How about the longest home run streak hit by Derek Jeter at night games on Tuesdays?

Discussion will include performance, CTEs, recursion, set-based vs. iterative analysis, and some pretty hairy TSQL!</p>

<h3>Treating Schema Like Code - Database Change Management with Liquibase</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the last few years modern source control systems and continuous integration tools have transformed how application code is developed, tested and deployed but in many cases the way we deploy database changes has not changed at all. It is all too common to hear about teams managing their database with an ad-hoc system of SQL migration scripts manually deployed to various development, testing and production environments. The database supporting your application is arguably just as important as the application code. So why do we treat it differently? 

In this talk I will discuss using the open source tool Liquibase to track, manage and apply database changes throughout every step of your development cycle alongside the application code changes.  You will learn how Liquibase manages database changes, how to keep your schema up to date with your code base and some best practices, tips and tricks to using Liquibase. </p>

<h3>Pragmatic Power BI:  Transforming Data</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Once we’ve extracted data from a source, we typically need to clean, or otherwise change, that data in preparation for loading it into Power BI.  In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson will explore the options Power BI offers to unpivot, filter, sort, aggregate, and perform other needed operations to make these preparations.  We’ll employ a dataset containing issues that commonly present real-world challenges, and work through the steps we can take in Power BI to transform the data to a state that works within Power BI.  Moreover, we’ll define calculations, and get a glimpse of the M language that underlies transformational processes we construct.</p>

<h3>SQL Server XML 101</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>XML processing become more and more a part of our daily life. Today anyone, DBA or Developer, interferes one way or another with XML-based processes. In the SQL Server XML 101 session I'll go over XML data type from "ground zero" to advanced tricks and tips. Using real life examples I'll show most efficient ways to work with an XML of any complexity and size. I'll cover the problems that you can anticipate to deal with with XML. How to: load the files using T-SQL code, dynamically retrieve and element or attribute, use different XML data types' methods and functions.</p>

<h3>Machine Learning with R Presented with R/Shiny</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You've seen demos on Azure Machine Learning Studio but did you know the real magic is done by calls to R code. In fact, R has been used to do predictive analytics for years which is why Microsoft integrated it into SQL Server 2016. In this presentation, we'll see how easy it is to select, train, and use models in R. We'll also discuss assessing the model's fit and comparing different models. All this will be done using Shiny, R's version of ASP .Net, i.e. essentially R Server Pages but amazingly easy to use which serves to demonstrate R's extensibility.</p>

<h3>Optimizing the SQL Server and Databases for large Fact Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>A session full of demos demonstrating how SQL Server startup parameters, trace flags and the create database and alter database command when used correctly for the underlying hardware can make scanning your fact tables much faster.

We will also as a side effect explore the Mary Go Round query feature and find ways to bulk load data faster and how to load from an OLTP system with zero impact to it.</p>
