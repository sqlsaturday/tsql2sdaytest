<h3>Performing a SQL Server Health Check</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues?  If you say never, I'm not surprised - many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have many gaping holes.  It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that have too much!)

Come learn how to use freely available tools to check your servers for basic issues like backups and CheckDB as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy and indexing.  If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!</p>

<h3>Query Processing in In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is the most important new feature in SQL Server 2014, and this session will teach you how query processing and optimization work with this new database engine. After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) than Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!

<h3>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Mythconceptions and Mythteries</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are a lot of misconceptions and mysteries in SQL Server due in large part to there be no single right answer for just about any question you have. How many times have you heard, ‘It Depends’ as the answer to a complex SQL Server question?  So often that it has almost become a joke.  When it’s your SQL Server, it’s no joke.

Why won't that query go parallel? Why won't the optimizer use that index? Why did rebuilding that index improve performance 10 times over?

Sometimes misconceptions become accepted as fact, and they spread. Occasionally, these mistold tales come from very reliable sources. It can be extremely difficult to tell what is fact and what is fable.

In this session, we will explore some of these misconceptions and mysteries turned myths and bust out the truth. We will prove the right answer and free you from these myths that have taken on a life of their own.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Backups and Restores A to Z</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you become the de facto DBA? Have you been tasked with the responsibility of backing up your databases? Do you feel that your database maintenance plan is adequate, but may be lacking in what it can do?  If these scenarios sound familiar, you’ll want to join this session, where Microsoft Certified Master (MCM) Keith Tate will walk you through the basics of backup and restore options. 
The session will begin with the reasons why databases must be backed up (hint: to restore them). Then, discuss the different recovery models and how they affect your backup strategy. Next, explore ways to automate backup and restore strategies, and review ways to improve the speed of your backups and restores. Finally, put it all together and you’ll be on your way to a disaster proof backup and restore strategy.

<h3>Best Practices for Excel Pivot Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The benefit of a direct-connected pivot table for the SQL Admin/Developer is: you no longer have to write and constantly tweak reports! Just give your users permission to run a stored procedure, and they can satisfy all their reporting needs through self-service.

Benefits for your business user: they can always drill down to the detail, be confident that it was not changed after retrieval from the database, and change parameters and refresh whenever they want, even after rearranging the report.

It requires no client software besides Excel, and has worked similarly since Excel 97. Nothing is required on the server except any version of SQL. (You can also connect to any data source with an ODBC driver!)

Although the concept is straightforward, there are some stumbling blocks to avoid. I will cover all the important points for setting up this solution, including:
1) Making the Connection
2) Configuring and Arranging the Table
3) Allowing Users to Change Parameters</p>

How SharePlex Replicates from Oracle to SQL Server and Eight Other Targets

Replicate from Oracle to a more economical and potentially easier-to-manage platform like SQL Server and experience less frustration when support is required. Offloading database activities to a SQL Server replica will leave more processing power and faster response times for your Oracle users. Users on the SQL Server target will enjoy near-real-time data on an instance that is tuned specifically for the purpose of reporting, analytics and other database activities while the Oracle production system remains tuned for online transaction processing (OLTP). In addition, SharePlex can be used to completely migrate an Oracle database to SQL Server without taking users offline during the migration process. A SQL Server target replica could be used to accomplish archiving or serve as a data warehouse</p>
