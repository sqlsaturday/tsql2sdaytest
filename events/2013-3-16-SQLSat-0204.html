<h3>Hierarchies... on Steroids the No RBAR Way</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Hierarchical data sets are everywhere. If you haven't worked with one yet, you will. If you're already working with them, you know they can be horribly complex, slow performing, difficult to maintain resource hogs that can really take the steam out of any GUI or batch process. This simple but code intensive "black arts" session shows you how to quickly and easily get around all of that using all 3 common hierarchical structures and a new structure that just might make Nested Sets obsolete. For stalwarts, it also includes a very high performance method (100,000 nodes in 6 seconds) for converting Adjacency Lists to Nested Sets that even a beginner can understand.  You just have to know that a Tally Table is involved somewhere in this. ;-)</p>

<h3>Demystifying BISM and Tabular Mode SSAS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With the release of SQL 2012, Analysis Services (SSAS) has seen some major changes.  An entire new method of modelling analytic data has emerged and it's called Tabular Mode Analysis Services.  In addition to that, a new semantic layer has been added to the tool, the Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM), which will help to bring the two modes -- Multidimensional and Tabular -- into one level playing arena.

In this session, attendees will gain understanding of what Multidimensional and Tabular modelling IS, as well as how the BISM layer helps to translate user requests to ensure no confusion is made. Attendees will also learn how to BUILD a Tabular model, and will help design a solution live during the presentation. </p>

<h3>$*! Your Database Says About Me</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Does your data sit around mocking your best attempts to support good data practices?  Databases are also bound by the GIGO rule: Garbage In is Garbage Out.  In this presentation, Karen shows you examples of the types of mistakes, misunderstandings and outright cheats that lead to poor data quality, mistrust in IT systems and overall smelliness in our IT solutions.  Using real-life evidence of her own data in your systems.</p>

<h3>Windowing Functions: THE Reason to Upgrade to 2012</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>For the first time since SQL 7 there is a compelling reason for EVERY SQL Server user to upgrade to the next version and this time around the reason is Windowing Functions.   And these are NOT limited to Enterprise Edition, like so many other really useful and important features!  The range of data processing needs that can be very efficiently and cleanly solved with these tools is stunning. In this demo-packed session we will cover as many features as we can pack into an hour's time, and you can take the demo code back home with you to review at your leisure!</p>

<h3>Goodbye Next Next Next, Hello Automated Installs</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Tired of clicking through all those setup screens and entering the same information over and over again? I know I am, so I'm doing something about it...I'm automating my installs!  From base SQL Server installs to Service Packs, Cumulative Updates and even Client Tools for DBA's and Developers, I'll show you ways to automate your installs using SQL Server FineBuild (CodePlex Project).  We'll cover many of the scenarios you may encounter and you'll walk away with some pre-built install scripts to help get you started.</p>

<h3>Partitioning for Perf and Management of Large Tabl</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning seamlessly solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</p>

<h3>Manage SQLServer Efficiently w/PowerShell Remoting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You have more and more servers to manage and less time to accomplish everything. You're writing scripts to automate those tasks but they still take time to run. PowerShell remoting allows you to manage servers without the overhead of Remote Desktop, and allows you to run processes on all your servers simultaneously.  In this session we'll walk through how PowerShell remoting works, how to set it up, and how you can save time getting things done more quickly.</p>

<h3>Free SQL Tools for Your Toolbox</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every SQL developer or DBA should have a fully stocked toolbox that they can turn to in times of need. SQL Server enjoys a wide variety of support from 3rd party vendors that provide tools to help us peek under the hood and pinpoint issues. Sometimes we either don't have the budget for everything we would like, or we need something for a one-off project. In this session we will examine some of the free tools published by members of the SQL community and 3rd party vendors. </p>

<h3>Making SSIS 2008 Packages More Dynamic</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The expression language in SQL Server Integration Services is rich, and there are many locations within a package where the expression language can be used to make packages more dynamic. Within Derived Column transformations, Precedence Constraint evaluation, Script Tasks, Connection Managers, Containers and more, expressions and variables can be used to increase the flexibility of an SSIS package. Remember, “Write once, run many!”</p>

<h3>SQL Audit - auditing doesn't have to be boring</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Let's face it, auditing isn't sexy.  But if you're a DBA, you need to know what's going on in your SQL Server instance.  Fortunately, SQL Audit makes it easy.  In this session, we'll cover what you can and can't audit using SQL Audit, enhancements in 2012, configuring database and server audits, ways to process output, and ideas for how to implement SQL Audit on a larger scale.  Auditing doesn't have to be hard.  And with the help of a little custom coding, it can even be sexy.  </p>

<h3>Using Filetables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The FileStream feature was introduced with SQL Server 2008 allowing BLOBs to be managed by the DB. In 2012, FileTable expands on this feature by using specific tables for storing these BLOBs. This allows Windows apps to access these items as if there were stored on the file system.</p>
