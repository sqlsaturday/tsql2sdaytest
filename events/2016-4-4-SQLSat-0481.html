<h3>Reporting Services with Geospatial Visualization</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Reporting Services with Geospatial Visualization 
specifically: „from address data to data-presentation in SSRS Mapcontrol in 3 steps.“ Each company has address data in the relational form [street], [postcode] und [place]. In a first step the transition to Geodata is presented in the form of longitude and latitude. The question of data source and data quality is also an issue addressed in this section. The next step deals with the selection of appropriate maps. Of special note is the data-matching of the maps with the address data. Also the own production of map sections will be illustrated in an example. The third step is to conduct the use and configuration of the control and the reference to the report data</p>

<h3>Understanding the Azure Data Stack</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Today’s data world is changing. Relational databases are no longer considered the only option for a data project. 
With Azure as its front line, Microsoft pushes many new technologies out to the wild, and it’s important to understand their capabilities, strengths and weaknesses.

Why? Because when designing a solution, it’s important to choose the right tool for the right job, and SQL Server is not always the best choice. It’s also important to understand the new technologies in order to be able to explain why SQL Server IS the right tool when it is.

Among others, we will talk about Azure SQL Database, Stream Analytics, DocumentDB, Search, HDInsight, Machine Learning, Data Lake, U-SQL, and more.

Join this session to know how the DBA's role might be affected, get an understanding of the new technologies, when to use which one, and how to converge them into a robust data solution.

<h3>No Schema, No Problem! – Introduction to Azure DocumentDB</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session presents an overview of Azure DocumentDB, a new massively-scalable, fully managed NoSQL database platform designed specifically for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports a schema-free data model and scales easily. But it also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios.

We begin by explaining NoSQL and document databases, and how they compare with traditional relational database platforms. Then we tour the many features of DocumentDB, including rich querying with SQL (that’s right, you query this NoSQL database using SQL!), and client development using the REST API and the DocumentDB SDKs. Next, learn about the server-side programming model and write fully transactional stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions. Also explore tunable consistency, scale-out partitioning, custom indexing, attachments, and more. Attend this session, and get up to speed on DocumentDB today!</p>

<h3>T-SQL User-Defined Functions, or: Bad Performance Made Easy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of code encapsulation and reuse, and still get good performance.</p>

<h3>Practical SQL 2014\2016 Data Mining and introduction to R</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>
Microsoft have acquired Revolution Analytics in order to help customers to find their "Big Data" value. Revolution Analytics is the leading commercial provider of software and services for R, the world’s most widely used programming language for statistical computing and predictive analytics. R will be integrated to SQL 2016 BI. I will give introduction to R and the advantages it gives to Microsoft Data Mining.  
• An introduction to data mining  
• SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) Installations  

• Demo : Creating a data mining solution with Microsoft association rules  

• DEMO : Decision Trees example- In short  

• Prediction with MDX queries , No need to know the syntax .  

• Identifying Data Patterns – Predictive Models in SSAS</p>

<h3>Built-in JSON support in SQL Server 2016 and tips to improve performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>JSON defines a small set of formatting rules, designed to be as lightweight as possible text format, for the serialization of structured data. JSON can represent four primitive types (Strings, Numbers, Booleans, and Null) and two structured types (Objects and Arrays).

SQL Server 2016 provides built-in support for importing, exporting, parsing, and querying JSON documents. However, JSON support is not the same as the native JSON type, and it implemented using NVARCHAR type. This might lead to bad performance. For example, there's no built-in option for indexing, which can give us direct use of data as structured data.

In this session we will demonstrate several built-in JSON support functions in SQL Server 2016, and we will finish with some tricks and tips to improve performance.</p>

<h3>TDE - Encrypting your DB with PKI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Learn how to encrypt your database like a pro. 
After this one session you will understand the most common encryption/decryption methods and you will be able to deploy them yourself. On top of using MSSQL's built-in API to create keys and certificates - you will be able to create and load external "stronger" keys thus dramatically increasing your security.

<h3>SQL Server execution plans – hidden and tricky optimizations</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In this session, I'll present some hidden and tricky optimizations that will help you to "speed-up" your queries. It all begins by looking at the query execution plan and from there, we'll explore the alternatives that were not initially considered by query optimizer and understand what is it doing. If you need to optimize queries in your work, don't miss this session. </p>
