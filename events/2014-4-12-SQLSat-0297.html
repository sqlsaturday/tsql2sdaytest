<h3>Faster  Leaner: Optimize DW Solution Delivery with Power Pivot and AS Tabular</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You may not see this in the marketing materials, but the reality is PowerPivot and AS Tabular together provide some powerful options for Data Warehousing professionals.  This session is for DW  dimensional modeling pros interested in streamlining  optimizing the design  delivery process for enterprise-quality data marts  dimensional semantic models.

We'll touch on Agile  Lean disciplines,  how they can be applied to DW solution delivery. Then we’ll walk through demos of practical applications in the form of PowerPivot POCs  prototypes that can be promoted to AS Tabular models and refitted to the finished DW structures once delivered. We’ll focus on key DW challenges and how these technologies and techniques can be used to speed and improve effectiveness of requirements gathering and user testing, optimize sequencing of deliverables, minimize risk of rework and ultimately deliver quality DW solutions successfully.</p>

<h3>SQL Server Murder Mystery Hour: Dead Reports Don't Talk</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SABOTAGE? MURDER?

Before a pivotal meeting to secure venture capital, a key report vanishes from the server without a trace, leaving Cromulent Technologies' future in jeopardy. Our group must solve the crime. Time is critical as the CEO has promised to explain the matter to investors just sixty minutes from now. Only with your investigative skills, SQL Server knowledge, and teamwork can we find the missing report, bring the perpetrator to justice, and save Cromulent Technologies!

SQL Server Murder Mystery Hour is part technical presentation, part networking event. We'll focus on Reporting Services administration in areas that are vital to business continuity: security roles, encryption keys, and backups. All attendees have a part to play.</p>

<h3>SMO Internals for High Performance PowerShell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever wanted to know what happens behind the scenes in SQL Server when you use PowerShell and SMO to manage a SQL Server?  How fast can your automation really go? I will take you through a few common objects in SMO and the internals of what happens when you use those objects. We will examine the TSQL that is generated, and learn techniques that lead to high efficiency.  We will dive deep through the collections that make SMO the powerful tool it is. Combining the flexibility of PowerShell and SMO Internals is a recipe for awesome sauce.  Come peek behing the curtain and squeeze the speed out of your automation scripts using PowerShell and SMO.  You'll be glad you did.</p>

<h3>Capture Change and Apply it With Change Data Capture  SSIS</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to setup a new data warehouse, keep it updated, audit changes to your databases or quickly load changes to another database Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution for all of these and can now be setup and supported easily with SQL Server  SSIS 2012! Change Data Capture (CDC) has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is setup on your databases. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes.</p>

<h3>Getting Started with Execution Plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are times when you are able to be proactive and tune existing queries. Sometimes, you will receive a phone call from your manager telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is underperforming, hogging resources or timing out, one of the first things you want to examine is the query execution plan. An execution plan provides a wealth of information that can help you quickly diagnose what is wrong. In this beginner level session you will learn what an execution plan is, how to find it, and how to interpret it to see what the query optimizer is doing and find the major pain points.</p>

<h3>Tabular Models</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Tabular modules allow developers to create models based upon different data sources; create hierarchies, perspectives, partitions and roles similar to traditional OLAP cubes.  In this session will highlight the differences between traditional OLAP and tabular models and reasons for selecting one approach over another. I will demonstrate how to create a data model first in power pivot model and then import into an Analysis Services Tabular Project.  Working with the imported data I will then create measures, KPIs, perspectives, and implement security. Finally I will deploy the model to an Analysis Server.</p>

<h3>I Don't Know Which Queries Are Slow, Just Make All of Them Faster</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Shortly after learning how to troubleshoot a poorly performing queries it's not unusual for a DBA to discover a nasty surprise - some (or perhaps most) of your users will not be able to actually tell you what query is performing poorly. The good news is that SQL Server does know! This session covers some of the basics of looking through the plan cache for slow queries, including some tips on spotting potential parameter sniffing issues when you don't have the luxury of actual execution plans.</p>

<h3>Database Design: Size DOES Matter</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Great database performance starts with great database design. During the database design process it is important to select your datatypes wisely. The wrong choices will often lead to wasted space, increased response times, and less stability. Additionally you run the risk of having your design not scale as well as it should. Leave this session armed with the knowledge you need to help your databases perform at their peak efficiency. </p>

<h3>The Curious Case of Isolation Levels</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you ever seen or used “WITH (NOLOCK)” in T-SQL? Do you know what it does and its side effects? Is SQL Server optimistic or pessimistic when it comes to locking? Can it be both? In this session we will cover these questions and discuss how and why SQL Server takes locks and how that affects other users. We will go over alternatives for using NOLOCK and discuss when it is appropriate to use. In addition, we will discuss what are the ACID properties and how to monitor locks and blocks.</p>

<h3>Managing SQL Server Performance with Extended Events</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of a DBA's primary responsibilities is managing the performance of a SQL Server environment. When performance problems arise, DBAs need to have the correct tools in place to be able to dig in and discover the issues that are occurring. Although it's one of the newer tools in the DBA toolbox, Extended Events is one of the most powerful tools available. In this session, we will discuss performance management responsibilities for DBAs and provide a foundation, through Extended Events, to understand and resolve performance issues.</p>

<h3>SSIS Logging Reconsidered</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The advent of SQL Server 2012, SQL Server Data Tools and Integration Services Catalogs have significantly improved out of the box logging.  Unfortunately, logging best practices have not evolved with the new logging tools.  This talk will outline the logging available “out of the box” with SSIS and discuss the implications for “traditional” ETL logging.  Logging best practices will vary by business, industry and regulatory environments.  We will review examples from the most basic operational logging to the most sophisticated logging required for auditing and regulatory compliance. </p>

<p>SQL Server Replication is an important tool that I’ve implemented many times for reliable data movement to support Business Intelligence architectures. This includes using replication to create databases that are used as sources for data warehouses, reporting systems, operational data stores, and historical audit trails.  The key concepts to consider when setting up replication will be covered, including replication type, table selection, filters, indexing, and more.  Live demonstrations will show how to implement transactional replication for high performance in a real-time environment.</p>
