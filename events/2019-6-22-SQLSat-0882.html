<h3>Power BI for the Data Systems Administrator</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data systems administrators pride themselves on their ability to dig deep into the weeds of their systems and get to the root of problems. However, when it comes time to explain a complex or intermittent issue, we find that others don’t enjoy those weeds. Ever wish you could draw a better picture of what’s going on? Enter Power BI! This tool is beloved by many analysts and developers but it can transform more than just OLTP data. Attend this session to learn how you can use quick models in Power BI against administrative data such as the SSRS execution log, SQL Server Extended Events, XML  JSON files, query performance data, and even those random Excel files you get from vendors. You’ll leave this session with the skills you need to survey your domain from a new angle and communicate what you learn to your organization.</p>

<h3>How to do a Complete SQL Server Assessment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Completing a full assessment on a SQL Server is essential to learning about not only the current state of the server, but also any area that may be impacting performance or security.  If you have more than one DBA, it is also important to have all the DBA team members review the same areas when completing an assessment.  During this session we will discuss when assessment are useful, what should be included in the assessment as well as how to interpret the results.  We will use a SQL script that will capture all the data needed.  This script will more than 88 data points, including fragmentation of indexes, performance counter values, server and database security information, queries that consume the most CPU time including execution plans as well as many other data points. This session will also cover to document your findings and recommendations.</p>

<h3>Always Encrypted - Now with Enclaves!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you took a look at Always Encrypted in SQL Server 2016, you may have had some reservations about it. It was a great concept, but because the database engine could no longer access the data, a lot more of the data processing was pushed to the clients. For many companies, that was far from ideal.

Enter SQL Server 2019. With Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves, the benefits of Always Encrypted are retained, but the SQL Server engine gains the ability to carry out operations on the data - without the data ever leaving the server, and without decryption. How is this possible? Does it live up to its promises? Come to this session to find out and to see how to use it in your applications.</p>

<h3>SSDT, Docker, and (Azure) DevOps: How to Make Your Database Builds a First Class CI/CD Citizen</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Your application developers benefit from Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices to accelerate feature deployment and catch regression issues up front, but your database deployments are still stuck in the proverbial dark ages. The build scripts might be in source control or even an SSDT project already, but deploying is still an exercise in creating the perfect script, and don't even think about making a data (or data type) change!

SSDT and Azure DevOps can solve some of these problems, and even give us a window into the world of automated testing. In this talk, we will explore how to automate your database builds and deployments using SSDT and Azure DevOps, and we will explore automated testing using tSQLt and Docker. Lastly, we will check up on some tasks that you cannot (or should not) automate and talk about how to make sure your application developers are not left behind.</p>

<h3>Why do I need Analysis Services?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you have or are you developing a BI roadmap without Analysis Services? Do you write a lot of SSRS reports with SQL queries, views or stored procedures? Have you heard about Analysis Services but don't know if it's a good fit for you? Are you trying to decide whether you should go with Tabular or OLAP? Are you thinking about using Power BI? Are your business users hungry for data? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you probably need Analysis Services.

In this session we will go over use cases for Analysis Services and highlight the differences and strengths of each flavor of SSAS. We will review typical BI architectures and show how adding Analysis Services can turn your report users into happy and self sufficient data analysts. If you have a data warehouse(or even if you don't) and aren't using SSAS, come learn how SSAS will make your users love you.

Prerequisites: no prerequisites.</p>

<h3>He's Assertive, She's Aggressive: Recognizing patterns of unconscious bias in the workplace</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Social science has shown that people tend classify one another by gender, race, or other physical characteristics and instinctively react based on stereotypes and cultural norms.  These automatic prejudices (often called unconscious bias) contribute to the disproportionate success of white men in STEM when compared to equally qualified women or minorities.  The difference between unconscious bias and intentional discrimination is that the people that participate in it are often motivated to end these behaviors when they're brought to their attention.

This discussion will cover some common patterns of unconscious bias that occur in the workplace and offer real, concrete actions to intervene as an employee, a manager, or an organization.</p>

<h3>Diagnosing and fixing deadlocks in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You know how locking works in SQL Server, but now you are tasked with diagnosing and fixing deadlocks. How do you take the knowledge you have and apply it to address deadlocks in your production database?

In this session, we will discuss how you can use free tools to detect and analyze deadlocks in your system. We will do a deep dive on deadlock XML with an eye toward interpreting the information automatically collected by SQL Server when the free tools fall short. 

Attendees will leave with the understanding they need to develop solutions to deadlocks in their systems.</p>

<h3>Everyone Has a Story to Tell: Developing Your First Presentation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Ever considered giving a presentation of your own? Pondered how your favorite speakers got their start? Contemplated whether you could ever do that too, but were not sure where to begin?

Well I say you can and will show you how to get started! In this session, I will teach you how to develop your idea and create session content, and share tips  tricks that I have learned along the way. 

You will leave armed with a wealth of resources (and hopefully some inspiration) to venture forth and develop your first presentation.</p>

<h3>Analysis Services is in Azure? Seriously!? Let's build a model!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you used SSAS before? Have you created reports using T-SQL and Group by? Are you interested in or currently using Power BI? Do you you have a need for Analysis  Services but don't want to have to deal with the hassle of buying and installing a server? Are you dreading having to upgrade your hardware for your current SSAS Tabular instance?  Is your organization using Office 365?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might need Azure Analysis Services.  The wait is over! Azure Analysis Services is the platform as a service version of the wildly popular Analysis Services Tabular product. 

This demo heavy session will be focused on setting up Azure Analysis Services, deploying a model, loading the model with data and finally reporting from your Azure Analysis Services instance.

Prerequisites: Prior knowledge of SSAS or Power BI</p>

<h3>Modern SQL Server CPU Architecture</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, public cloud CPU selection, and SQL Server instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers for both on-prem and cloud-based SQL Servers.</p>

<h3>Why is my DBA So Grumpy ... When I Use NOLOCK and Other Query Hints.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Most of us have heard that using the NOLOCK hint is not recommended. But why is this? What is it about NOLOCK that sends most DBAs into a tizzy? And how about other hints such as ROWLOCK and RECOMPILE - are they OK to use? Come hear a discussion on why exactly query hints cause problems when used excessively, and watch some demos of NOLOCK craziness in action.</p>

<h3>Introduction to reading execution plans</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>One of the best starting places for performance tuning is the execution plan.

But in the real world, execution plans become complicated very quickly and it can be difficult to know where to start.

This session will demonstrate how execution plans can be interpreted to explain performance, including details on how SQL Server retrieved the data.</p>

<h3>Weird Stuff I Saw While ... Working With Heaps</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>We've all been told at some point that heaps are usually bad for select, update, and delete performance. But how bad are they really? Can they also be problematic for worloads that are _mostly_ insert? Are they always recommended for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations? Does it help to create non-clustered indexes on top of heaps? For this installment of Rick's "Weird Stuff" series we will take a closer look at why heaps can cause issues and maybe see a deadlock or two.</p>

<h3>Accelerated Database Recovery: The Future of the Transaction Log</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>New in SQL Server 2019, Accelerated Database Recovery (ADR) completely redesigns the SQL Server database engine recovery process.  This allows the time spent recovering from a crash or rolling back a transaction to be greatly reduced.  ADR also prevents the transaction log from growing during a long-running transaction.  Join me for this session to learn about ADR architecture and to see demonstrations of what it can do.</p>
