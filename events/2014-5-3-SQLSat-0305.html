<h3>Configuring Security in SharePoint for SQL BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Microsoft SharePoint Server is a fantastic option to surface SQL Server Business Intelligence tools to end users (SSRS, PowerVIew and PowerPivot, SQL Tabular, SQL BISM).

Yet, this tends to be a little tricky because the SQL Server Professionals do not understand all SharePoint aspects and vise versa.

To make matters worse, SharePoint architecture underwent a huge change from kerberos to claims and this meant a lot of pervious concepts don't appy and lot of new tools are not claims aware.

The objective of this session is to clarify

1. Clarify how to configure SQL BI in a Claims based SharePoint 2013 environment.
2. What works and what does not work with claims.
3. All necessary terms and concepts provided to SQL Professionals who will them be able to work with the SharePoint teams fearlessly.
4. Advanced consultants, will be able to configure the integration between SharePoint and SQL BI completely.

<h3>Enterprise Business Intelligence: Past, Present and Future</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The way companies are thinking about data and business intelligence is changing fast.  Traditional models for building and delivering BI are under siege from new technologies and new methodologies.  As we work through the hype cycles of end-user BI and big data approaches, we’ll discuss how these are affecting enterprise BI, as practiced both inside IT and outside of IT.  We’ll discuss how new trends and tools conflict and coexist with traditional IT BI practice.  And we’ll discuss what the future of Enterprise BI might actually look like when the dust settles.   What role will IT play in Business intelligence?  What role with the data warehouse play?  Are they going away, or just changing?  And what skills might be most important for the next 10 years?</p>

<h3>Modern Data Warehousing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The traditional data warehouse has served us well for many years, but new trends are causing it to break in four different ways: data growth, fast query expectations from users, non-relational/unstructured data, and cloud-born data.  How can you prevent this from happening?  Enter the modern data warehouse, which is able to handle and excel with these new trends.  It handles all types of data (Hadoop), provides a way to easily interface with all these types of data (PolyBase), and can handle big data and provide fast queries.  Is there one appliance that can support this modern data warehouse?  Yes!  It is the Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW).  In this session I will dig into the details of the modern data warehouse and PDW.  I will give an overview of the PDW hardware and software architecture, identify what makes PDW different, and demonstrate the increased performance.</p>

<h3>Don’t Miss Out on Excel Cube Functions</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Cube functions have existed since Excel 2007, but they’re not as well known nor as well publicized as other methods to obtain data from Analysis Services/PowerPivot sources. Business Analysts may feel confined to tabular (symmetrical) reports with pivot tables. BI Developers may avoid Excel because they want the ability to write advanced calculations in MDX and the extensive formatting capabilities of Reporting Services. And Power View limits you to the sets, calculations, and captions available in the data source and doesn’t provide drillthrough detail. We’ll start with the basics of how to write and use cube functions, then employ them to build a nicely formatted, asymmetrical, parameter-driven report that overcomes the previously noted limitations.</p>

<h3>Choose Your Geospatial/Mapping Adventure</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>You have geospatial data and you know that plotting it on a map will deliver insights. Or maybe you keep hearing “geospatial” as a current BI buzzword and you want to be informed about your options when you get to it. The Microsoft BI stack provides several options for visualizing location data. But how do you know which tool will best serve your purpose, or what factors are important in making this decision? We’ll identify factors to consider when choosing a tool to visualize your data in maps such as system requirements, availability and type of location data, required level of technical understanding, and more. You’ll leave the session confident in your ability to choose the best tool within Excel and SQL Server.</p>

<h3>SSIS project deployments with multiple developers</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Before SQL Server 2012, it was easy to develop several SSIS packages in a project and deploy each package as you complete it.  However SQL Server 2012 introduces the project deployment model.  With its awesome features comes the limitation that you can no longer deploy a single package.  You must deploy the whole project every time!  How do you deploy a project that contains a mix of deployed packages, ready to deploy packages and packages in development?

In this session I demonstrate common problems that arise in the package development lifecycle that affect project deployment.  I will then demonstrate how to use Team Foundation Server to address these problems.  I will develop the story for handling packages at various stages of development using TFS.

<h3>Tell Better Stories with Microsoft BI and PowerMap</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Storytelling seems to be a lost art form; in this fast-paced world people are more interested in getting as many bits of information as they can. But without a story, something to pull all the data together, the target audience will probably gloss over your message. Throwing a few numbers and charts at the reader has become pretty acceptable nowadays. But to make something truly memorable, and hopefully shared with someone else, you need some kind of story. You need something to tie it all together, to give it some meaning. That’s where Microsoft steps in with its latest addition to the Business Intelligence Analytics space with an add-in to Excel called PowerMap.</p>

<h3>Data Lake and Interactive Query In Hadoop</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>85% of the world’s data is unstructured and over 20 billion terabytes of data is fast coming to organizations. And business wants more data. Welcome to the world of Hadoop. Hadoop allows organizations to store massive amount of data in one single place regardless of structure and format and provides a way to interact with the data using SQL via Hive.  Hive is the SQL de facto standard for querying Hadoop data. It is rich with SQL semantics and utilizes YARN  Tez frameworks that powers interactive query for Hive. </p>
