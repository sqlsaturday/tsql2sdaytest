<h3>Devs are from Mars, Report Servers are from Venus</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Do you remember what it was like to fall in love? Wasn't it wonderful?

Lately it just hasn't been the same. You've been stuck in the same old routine, doing the same old charts and tables. Maybe Reporting Services doesn’t tell you what’s wrong. Maybe you're even thinking about seeing other reporting products. Maybe you and RS just weren't meant to be together.

In this session, Doug will re-ignite your passion for RS by showing you how to design for better performance, explaining what RS has been trying to tell you through logs (but you haven't been listening), and demonstrating some new -- and easy -- tricks you may not have known RS can do. After this session, you'll want to spend some time alone with your new old flame.</p>

<h3>The Tally Table: What it is/how it replaces loops</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Don’t let the “Intermediate” rating scare you “Beginners” away.  This “Black Arts” session is for anyone that uses T-SQL. There are dozens of things we do in SQL that require some type of iteration. "Iteration" means "counters" and "loops" to most people and recursion to others. To those well versed in the techniques of "Set-based" programming, it means some form of a "Numbers" or "Tally" Table, instead. SQL Server MVP Jeff Moden takes the mystery out of how this wonderfully compact tool works and how it easily replaces many types of loops. This session has been updated to include additional information about what “Pseudo-Cursors” are and how they work as well discovering why “Recursive CTE’s” can be your worst enemy.</p>

<h3>You’re My Density: Making Sense of Statistics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Query Optimizer uses statistics to decide how to execute a query.  If statistics are out of date, improperly sampled or simply don’t exist, then you could unintentionally deceive the Optimizer. Accurate statistics can help avoid poor query plans, so if you’re not familiar with how to read a histogram, the various options for updating statistics or want to know why sample size does matter, this session is for you! We will also delve into what happens when a value doesn’t exist in a statistic, discuss methods to manage statistics for volatile tables and examine the challenges that exist with statistics on partitioned tables. Expect a session filled with demos and real-world examples that will create a foundation of statistics knowledge.</p>

<h3>Cross Tabs  Pivots: Converting Rows into Columns</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Don’t let the “Intermediate” rating scare you “Beginners” away.  This “Black Arts” session is for anyone that uses T-SQL.   SQL Server MVP Jeff Moden demonstrates and explains simple methods for converting gobs of “vertical data” into horizontal numeric and textual data by date or other key using Cross Tabs and Pivots.  This session includes the “Black Arts” method of “Pre-Aggregation” for incredibly high performance and how to dynamically and automatically produce reports based on a date.  The methods learned in this session can be used to provide “dynamically pivoted” result sets to SSRS, Crystal Reports, and other reporting software.</p>

<h3>PowerPivot - A cool reporting tool! (</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The future of BI is self-service reporting and PowerPivot is the conduit to that goal. We will explore how to use the PowerPivot add-in for Excel 2010 to tie different data sources together and deliver analytics.

In this session you will learn how to use PowerPivot (within the familiar interface of Excel) to combine different data sources such as Analysis Services cubes, TSQL queries, Stored Procedures, Excel spreadsheets, flat files and data from the web to create basic PivotTables and PivotCharts in Excel. The data these new spreadsheets overcomes the 1,048,576 row limitation in Excel 2007/2010, contains refreshable data sources and has excellent data compression and lighting fast speed thanks to the utilizati</p>

<h3>The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. 

In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yeild interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can go awry as well! Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!</p>

<h3>Visualizing Your Indexes - Science behind the Art </h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Indexes make queries run faster, right? Not always, no. And finding the right indexes for your needs is often more of an Art than a Science. Attend this session as we take a visual tour of how indexes are laid out and the way data is accessed when indexes are utilized. We will discuss clustered indexes as well as non-clustered indexes and also when to use indexed views along with some other variations.</p>

<h3>Read Dirty to Me - Understanding Isolation</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.</p>

<h3>T-SQL : Bad Habits to Kick</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Bad habits: we all have them. SELECT * is the obvious one; but in this session you will learn about various other habits and why they can be bad for performance or maintainability. Come learn how these habits develop, what kind of problems they can lead to, and how you can avoid them. Eliminating these habits will lead to more efficient code, a more productive work environment, and - in a lot of cases - both.</p>

<h3>Leaving the Windows Open</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Computing running totals, averages by state or group, and other complex aggregations are not easy to implement in many relational databases. Thankfully, many relational databases include support for window functions. Window functions are an extension to the ANSI SQL standard. More than just another part of SQL, window functions enable complex ranking, ordering, and other aggregations over a subset of rows in a query. Understanding the capabilities of window functions lets you extend application functionality, build rich and complex queries, and reduce overhead in the application tier.</p>

</h3>
<p>Doing proof of concept projects and pushing the limits of technology are the passions in my professional life. Many people do projects just because they are assigned to them, but I like to ask questions like "who, what, when, where, why, how and how often". Finding the answers to these simple inquiries saves not only me, but the people (and teams) around me time, money and resources.
I also make spending time with my wife and 2 kids, attend a local PASS user group and enjoy life!</p>
