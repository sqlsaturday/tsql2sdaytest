<h3>One key to rule them all - how to effectively destroy data consistency, and ruin query performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Every beginner knows that every table has an identity primary key, supported by a clustered index.
If I told you that these keys that you take for granted, are the primary factor that destroy your database's consistency, performance, scalability, and modularity, you'd probably think I'm crazy.
But what if I can prove it, scientifically, and beyond any reasonable doubt?
"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know that just ain't so..."
Join me on this fascinating journey down the rabbit hole, where we will shed new light on some of the most fundamental aspects of database design. 
You will experience hands-on how you can drastically improve your database consistency, simplify your queries, improve performance by orders of magnitude, allow for unprecedented scalability, and modularity. Prepare for a paradigm shift. 
By the end of this session, you will chant with me:
"The key, the whole key, and nothing but the key, so help me Codd".</p>

<h3>SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.</p>

<h3>Big Data, Big Dupe: A little session about a big bunch of nonsense.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If data is the new oil, then Big Data is the new snake oil. 
For over a decade, Big Data has managed to delude far too many smart, honest, hard-working data practitioners, with nothing but the best intentions.
This session is a plea for your common sense and decency. 
Together, we will use history, facts, authority, and logic to expose it for what it really is. 
Layer by layer, we will peel off the Confusion, Illusion, Deception, Distraction and the Regression that is "Big Data".
You will realize just how much progress and value Big Data has bestowed on us over the past decade.
But more importantly, we will see what we can and must do to make data practice, and consequently the world, a better place. 
Brace yourself for a thought-provoking session, filled with "Aha" moments. 
I promise that after this session, you will never look at big data the same way as you did before you stepped into the room.</p>

<h3>Monitor Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Monitoring Power BI means having knowledge of all the content currently hosted in your Power BI tenant. What datasets and reports have been published? What users have access to these resources? How often are they looking at these reports? How have data refreshes been performing?

By monitoring, you will truly understand what makes you an Administrator of Power BI. You'll see the different screens it takes to monitor everything in your tenant. Plus, you'll discover if there's a better way to monitor your tenant through collecting API data and analyzing it to derive some actionable insights for improved data governance in your companies.

BI expert Angel Abundez will demo the Power BI administrative screens you use today to monitor your tenant. Then he'll do some PowerShell development in VS Code to collect API data and see if it's possible to use that data in Power BI for added insights.</p>

<h3>Breaking the Social Code: How to be Socially Intelligent at Work</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is there a gap between your advanced technical skills and your social-emotional intelligence? Are you or your employees experiencing challenges communicating effectively with others, participating as part of a team, managing emotional reactions, or socially connecting at work? Is this impacting your ability to get promoted, retain employees, or establish positive workplace morale or relationships?  Do you want to increase your “likeability” factor for your professional growth and overall well-being? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you! For many people, “social” does not come naturally and has to be explicitly taught. In this presentation, you will learn about the mindset that is required for developing new competencies, key cognitive skills needed for social success, and tools and strategies that you can use immediately with your team. This session is for people who have difficulty navigating the social world, as well as for their managers.</p>

<h3>What to Do When SQL Server is Unusually Slow</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>“Is something going on with the SQL Server right now?” You hear those words, and your heart starts to race a little faster. You try to connect to the SQL Server, and it responds, but you can tell it’s a little slow. You open up Activity Monitor, look at recent expensive queries, and maybe open up the Windows event logs to see if anything’s happened recently.

There’s gotta be a better way, right?

Good news – there is, and you’re about to learn how the pros do it. In one all-demo session, you’ll watch Brent Ozar use sp_WhoIsActive, sp_BlitzFirst, and sp_BlitzCache to solve several common emergencies. You’ll walk away with a written checklist to solve typical performance emergencies.</p>

<h3>Reporting Services: A Smart Migration Strategy</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>With Power BI Report Server, you can host traditional paginated reports alongside Power BI analytical reports, KPIs and mobile reports.  This session will show how to use the data in the ReportServer database to determine a smart migration strategy for upgrading to a new SSRS or Power BI Report Server. Starting with the new features of Report Manager, Mobile reports, KPIs and the Mobile Report Publisher app. The session will then focus on how to utilize the report meta data in the ReportServer database, combined with the transaction log table, to show how to determine which reports, data sets and data sources are being used and determine what objects to migrate. Learn how to use PowerShell to extract the reports and data sets from the database, instead of downloading them, to facilitate an easy migration to a new implementation. Also discover a way of determining all TSQL used by the reports. This session is particularly useful for migrating from 2008 but applicable to any migration.</p>

<h3>Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!</p>

<h3>Environment Setup using automation tools like Docker, Powershell and Chocolatey</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Environment setup in some organizations can take days and even then it is not consistent and has components missing or configured incorrectly. These problems can be solved and this session will cover several techniques for doing just that. In this session we will use Docker to create 3 SQL environments. The first is a production like environment for UAT. In the second environment will redact the confidential data and in the third environment reduce the dataset by 90%.

This three tiered environment setup can work with or without Docker. In this session we will also cover using Chocolatey NuGet's, which sounds tasty, but it is also a very powerful method of installing software on Windows.</p>

<p>Michael Wall has been an IT professional going back to when he had his own software store and worked with his customers with their “dose” problems.  Originally hired by a small consulting firm to write web pages, he was thrust into the SysAdmin world when their lead consultant changed the passwords of all of the servers at a major pulp and paper company’s systems to 100%s$%t and walked out the door.  He was sent down with a copy of UNIX for Dummies and 50 cents for the bus ride back.  Fast forward a few years, he was asked if he wanted to be a DBA after successfully managing a fifty server Y2K upgrade.  Since then, he’s never looked back and has survived a number of data and system challenges.
