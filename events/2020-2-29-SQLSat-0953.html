<h3>Why should I care about ... the plan cache?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs often seem so frazzled. This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</p>

<h3>The Future Of The DBA In A Cloud Centric Environment</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The cloud is a reality that is hitting everyone. What does this mean to you as a database administrator? Will the skills you've built transfer or will you become unnecessary? 

These questions trouble many, and honestly, they should. If you are passionate about your profession you will want to prepare for change to ensure that your skills grow with the environments and technologies you support. 

This presentation will cover the transition that we have made at SP Global and the changes that our team has had to make as we've moved to cloud centric environments and technologies. 

This goal of this session is to encourage attendees to become life long learners and to develop a renewed passions to grow with the changes in technology so that they will stay impactful. Attendees will also leave with key areas that they can focus on that will propel them to be cloud ready as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly -- switching from SSIS to Informatica Cloud as an ETL Tool</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This talk will give managers and ETL developers a look at the differences between SSIS and Informatica Cloud.  It is an honest assessment of some of the differences (some good, some bad and some ugly) to help them decide which ETL tool might be a good fit for their organization.  It is not overly technical for non-technical management, but does touch some topics of interest for ETL developers on  the real-world loading of data between divergent systems and multiple platforms (Oracle and SQL Server).

The movie “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” is used to characterize the successes and failures during conversion of our ETL.  The following topics are discussed and awarded either a good, a bad or an ugly grade:
User Interface and Off Hour Support
Integration with Control-M
Upserts, Mappings and Stored Procedure Complications
Oracle and SQL Server Back End Data Extracts
Change Data Capture Extracts
Product360 and onward</p>

<h3>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.</p>

<h3>Thanks for the Feedback!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>... "Even when it is off-base, unfair, poorly delivered, and frankly, you are not in the mood."

Feedback is everywhere. Ever heard, "you need to become more well-rounded?" That's feedback. Ever seen your spouse yawn when you tell about your day? Ever been honked at at the green light because you zoned out for a second? You get the idea. 

All our lives we want to improve: we actively participate in conferences, we read blogs, we pursue hobbies, we use smart watches to get in shape. We want to be better but we also want to be accepted as who we currently are. And when we receive (often unsolicited) feedback, we feel inadequate. Not good enough. Unlovable. Not worthy. Impostors. 

This session won't teach you how to give feedback, because you've already been to several workshops teaching that (as a result of, well, feedback). It'll, instead, help you address your own "not good enough" triggers, initiate difficult conversations, and participate in them with less stress and more success.</p>

<h3>Streamline Database Deployments</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Have you tried implementing source control? How has your continuous integration (CI) process gone? 

This session is for developers, database administrators, database engineers, and data architects that want to automate their database deployments. Particularly for those individuals that have hit roadblocks along that way. We will discuss the differences between migration and stated-based deployment methods. We will also discuss options with branching and merging. 

At the end of the session, attendees will know how to select the best deployment method for their environment. In addition, attendees will be familiar with branching and merging strategies that can be used as part of their continuous integration strategy.

Attendees should be familiar with general concepts about source control and be comfortable with Visual Studio or VS Code.</p>

<h3>New features in Management Studio  -- Performance Troubleshooting made easier!</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools. Which enabled rapid enhancement to Execution Plan.

Do you know that you can now see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for the operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for an execution and what trace flags were active during compilation and which ones influenced compilation? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for table name, index name or column name without opening XML plan? When you see a clustered index was used do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows?

In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan. You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.</p>

<h3>Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>When it comes to getting your data into Excel or Power BI, M is your best choice. The M Language (A.K.A Power Query) is a powerful tool for self-service data preparation. However, it's not clear where it fits compared to tools like SSIS or TSQL. It's also not clear what it's limitations are. This session will cover the basics of M and when to use it.

In this session, we'll demonstrate how M is a linear series of transformations, just like a set of steps from a recipe. We'll show how 80% of what you will ever need to do can be done from the GUI. We'll also talk about how to write custom code for that other 20%. By the end of this presentation, you'll be able to take any manual cleanup you do today and turn it into a repeatable process with M.</p>

<h3>More Common Than You Think: Mental Illness in Tech</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Mental illness is more common than you think.  One in four Americans suffers from a mental illness each year.  In the tech community, this is often not talked about.  Many times, people feel alone and isolated in the tech community with us mostly being introverted people.  It is time to start talking about mental illness out in the open and honestly about how it affects us and those around us.

In this session, we will talk about what mental illness is and what it is not.  How my mental illness has affected me.  How it effects the tech industry.  How mental illness can affect you and how you can tell if you are starting to have issues.  What to say and what not to say to people you know that are affected by mental illness.  Finally, how to get help and where reach out for help.</p>

His first exposure to SQL Server was as a database developer, but over time he became more and more interested in how the database engine operated... eventually specializing more on performance issues than code.

Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.</p>
