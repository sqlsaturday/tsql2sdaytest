<h3>dbatools and Power BI walked into a bar</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Going into a new shop and don't know the environments can be intimidating.
The current DBA team/client just throws a list of instances where you should have access and want you to do magic!

Fortunately, we can leverage the dbatools PowerShell module to get a whole bunch of information that will give us a state of the art and help to answer some questions.
What resources (CPU/Memory) are allocated? Which version and edition is installed? What is the size evolution of my database, filegroup or table? Do you know how many records the biggest table is growing by every day? What will a forecast tell you about your database/file group/table size in 2 months? will you need more space?

I will show how you can save the information gathered by dbatools on a central database. On top of that, how can you leverage from a couple of Power BI dashboards that I have created. This dashboard will help you answer these and other questions faster than you thought it would be possible.</p>

<h3>SQL Server  Kubernetes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Running SQL Server in containers has huge benefits for Data Platform professionals but there are challenges to running SQL Server in stand alone containers. Orchestrators provide a platform and the tools to overcome these challenges.

This session will provide an overview of running SQL Server in Kubernetes, which is the leading orchestrator.

Topics covered will be: -
An overview of Kubernetes.
Definition of pods and services.
Deploying SQL Server containers to Kubernetes.
Persisting data for SQL Server in Kubernetes.
An introduction to Helm
Chaos engineering for SQL Server in Kubernetes using Space Invaders!

This session is aimed at SQL Server DBAs and Developers who want to learn the what, the why, and the how to run SQL Server in Kubernetes.</p>

<h3>"DAX" the way to do it</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, you just can't ignore DAX. In this session I'll show you it's true power and how by knowing it you can even completely rethink your data modelling!

Many times data models are configured in a way that the formulas which are applied to it are simple and fast to calculate. But with the Power of DAX, you can now achieve much more sophisticated and powerful calculations, while keeping it simple at the same time. And by knowing DAX, you can also plan your models in a better way just by leaving it up to DAX.

In this session you will learn:
- Handling different granularities
- Handling multiple factuals in the same model
- Calculations with disconnected tables
- Advanced Time intelligence
- Multiple formulas and tricks</p>

<h3>Continuous Intelligence... What's This All About?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Continuous Intelligence combines the terms of Continuous Integration and Business Intelligence and aims at defining and implementing processes to keep your implementation and deployment processes for your BI applications flexible and as seamless as possible.
Even in the near past, support for CI processes of BI projects was almost not there. But, the last few years brought some changes to the perception of this topic and shifted the mindset.
Let's look at advantages and challenges for CI in BI and at possibilities to implement such a process for Analysis Services.</p>
