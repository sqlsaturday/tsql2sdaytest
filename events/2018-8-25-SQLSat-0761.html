<h3>Building a Database DevOps Pipeline in the Cloud under 49 minutes</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>DevOps processes encompass both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

Continuous integration is based around automated builds and tests. Continuous Delivery allows both application developers, database developers and DBAs alike to deploy better quality code/software.  
In this DEMO heavy session, we will start off with source code only. 

Over the course of 49 minutes we will build a deployment pipeline that starts off with pushing our database and application code to source control. We will utilize Visual Studio Team Services to automate our build and tests and perform Continuous Integration operations. 

The output of these operations will be a standardized package of our built solution. 
Utilizing PowerShell in the form of Infrastructure as Code, we will spin up multiple Azure based environments that will be deployed to using automated Continuous Delivery processes.
The finished result will be an automated and reliable deployment pipeline that was built under 49</p>

<h3>Azure PaaS Databases - The Choice is Yours</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>From the beginnings of Azure SQL DB, we now have Elastic Pools, Managed Instances and even MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB. How do you work out which offering is the right one for you and once you have decided, how do you then ensure that you are looking after it adequately?
The choice night be easy for the non-SQL Server PaaS, but the choice for SQL Server between SQL DB, Elastic Pools and Managed Instances can become, well, "cloudy".
This session will explore the features available to each option to help guide you through the first part. We'll then look at what to do once you have your PaaS database deployed – what can you use to manage it and what maintenance tools are available in the service for each flavour.</p>

<h3>Data Privacy and the Data Professional.</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>It’s almost a daily occurrence to hear about some sort of data breach. 
But what are the consequences of a data breach – for both the victims and companies involved – and what does that mean for you as a data professional.
As governments start to legislate more in an effort to protect the privacy of its citizens the entire concept of data storage become more complex.
Exactly what is legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how will it affect around the world.
We’re seen Microsoft give us tools over the years – like Transparent Data Encryption and Dynamic Data masking - to help with this sort of thing – but is there a better answer?
Come along to this session and hear how you and your team can lessen your chances of being the ones responsible for the next data breach.</p>

<h3>Azure Machine Learning  Power BI - Perfect Combo for Predictive Analytics</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Is Machine Learning still a buzz word or can we easily put it to use to gain actionable insights from our data ?  
How amazing will it be to build visualization in Power BI forecasting the sales for a grocery chain or visualize property prices based on ML model ?

In this demo filled session, we will cover how you can find hidden patterns in the data, find outliers, predict results using real world data sets. 

AML is a cloud service which helps us to create predictive analytical solutions. Power BI is a powerful tool for both data analysis and visual representation.  Operationalizing the ML models thru the PBI service makes it a perfect combo.

In this session, we will build a predictive solution from scratch and visualize the models thru Power BI.
The audience will be equipped with sufficient knowledge to build, operationalize ML models and be able to apply to any real world data set by the end of the session.</p>

<h3>Creating Custom Visualisations with Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>While Power BI comes with a lot of useful visualisations out of the box, and third-party visuals and R gives you a lot more choice, sometimes you need full control over what is being displayed. This is not for the faint hearted, as you will require Typescript and JavaScript skills and an understanding of the D3 JavaScript libraries, but there is a lot of sample code to smooth the way. 

This session introduces you to writing your own fully interactive custom visualisations in NodeJS, how to troubleshoot and debug, culminating in deployment of the Visual to your Power BI environment, giving you the ability to display exactly what you want in your Power BI reports.</p>
