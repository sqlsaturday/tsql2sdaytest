<h3>Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 

TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.

In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 

A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.</p>

<h3>The Why and How of Partitioned Tables</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Previously restricted to Enterprise Edition, partitioning was one of the features pushed down to all Editions in SQL 2016 SP1. With greater availability comes greater responsibility to make sure it is implemented appropriately.
This session will demonstrate some of the common pitfalls with implementing partitioning:
•	how excessive data movement can kill performance
•	how poor maintenance can negate the performance gains
We’ll then look at how to plan and implement partitioning appropriately and some of the corresponding benefits that can be realised from a well implemented and managed partition scheme:
•	how to automatically maintain a partition scheme
•	how to implement a sliding window for data loading and archiving
•	how to plan and implement partitioning to limit data movement
Finally, we will consider the additional options open to us with partitioned tables from both the maintenance perspective, and the coding and tuning perspective.</p>

<h3>Azure Data Lake Analytics: Leveraging the Modern Data Warehouse</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>What you feared has come upon you: You’ve been happily building business intelligence solutions the traditional way for years; Finally, the big data curse has caught up with you. Your organization wants to exploit their big data along with their day-to-day transactional data. You are now tasked with storing all this in one place and working your analytics magic on it. You start wondering how and where you would store this data, what kind of hardware you would need and and how you would learn everything from storing to processing to analysis in a short time – after all big data is a different type of beast from transactional data.
Fear not, all you need to do is look to the heavens; with Azure Data Lake and Azure Data Lake Analytics, you could get started quite fast. After an introduction to Azure Data Lake, we will dive into how you could perform simple yet power analytics using methods that are familiar with Azure Data Lake Analytics.</p>

<h3>Power BI Adoption Framework</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Power BI has become the new Excel for many business users and its ease of use has made it viral within businesses of all shapes and sizes. 
Many Business Users started using Power BI with minimum / no IT collaboration that started causing concerns especially within larger organisations regarding security, governance, change management, etc.  With the risk of facing another spreadsheet hell in a different form, organisations have become increasingly aware of the need to put a governance and control process in place. 

In this presentation Iman will use his extensive experience in implementing and rolling out Power BI for many organisations to share some tips from his adoption framework for mid to large size organisations.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Always On Availability Groups Performance</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session is dedicated to a thoroughly examination of Always On Availability Groups in action. Various demos show how to analyze functionality and performance in the different stages in the life of an Availability Group: Initialization, Synchronization, and even Failover. We will follow the streams of data from insert on the primary to redo on the secondary and thereby gain a deep understanding of the architecture of availability groups with its special queues. We will also see the potential of the performance overhead on the workload and lag of a synchronous replica.  Get ready for a pure demo-session using DMVs, Extended Events, Perfmon and Wait Stats methodology.</p>

<h3>Mastering Temporary Objects</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>More and more Transact-SQL code is using temporary tables and table variables constructs. These constructs leverage the tempdb system database, which in turn becomes a severe performance bottleneck. This will be particularly "felt" when moving on-premise database solutions into the cloud. In this session we will cover the best practices in how you should be implementing these temporary constructs in your database solutions. We will discuss the differences between temporary tables and table variables, their impact on query performance and tempdb before looking a different implementations and best practices. We will examine a variety of techniques to improve temporary object performance, from hardware to the database engine configuration. Finally we will cover a number of key, proven techniques that can improve substantially performance. With lots of examples and case studies we will show how you can improve query performance by 20x or more.</p>

<h3>DAX as a Query Language</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Many people (business and IT) already use Power Pivot, Power BI and SSAS Tabular to produce reporting and analytics tools.  But did you know that these tools also have their own query language?   In traditional databases such as SQL server, it is possible to extract data into a new table.  The same is possible using DAX as a query language with a tabular data model.

In this session, Matt will introduce the topic and show how you can use DAX Studio to connect to a data model.  Once connected, DAX studio can be used to write queries over the tabular data model to start to interrogate the data itself (as opposed to simply aggregating the values into a pivot table or a Power BI report).  The learning can then be used to write more complex DAX measures or alternatively it can be used to extract tabular data directly into a table for further analysis.</p>

<h3>What is DevOps? - and why should I care?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>If you like an interactive and lively sessions them this is the place for you.
We’ll look at the background of this term – and see how it has transformed to bring focus to the data professional.
We’ll take a peak at what it means for the technology professional as well as what it means for the business professional - and we'll see Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and the cloud in action.
We’ll look at the different kinds of disciplines that lead to a well-rounded DevOps set up.
We’ll have a run through some of the motivations for developing a DevOps mindset and we’ll also hear about some of the arguments for non-adoption.
We’ll look at some of the other IT methodologies that we’ve seen emerge over the years and examine exactly what sets DevOps apart from these.
Regardless of if you’re never heard this term before or you have strong feeling about the subject – either way – you’ll leave the room with a new perspective and quite likely you’ll have contributed to your fellow delegates kn</p>

<h3>DBATools! The reason to finally start learning and using Powershell</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Powershell has been part of Windows for > 10 years and has been part of SQL Server since 2008.
In spite of this the adoption among Database Professionals for use in investigating and managing their environments has been low.

With the release of the open source DBA Tools module from DBATools.IO, with its 300+ commands, the time has arrived for Database Professionals to embrace PowerShell and upgrade their skills to support the modern Hybrid environment.

In this session we will look how to download, install and begin using the power within both this module and Powershell.

No prior experience with Powershell required!</p>
