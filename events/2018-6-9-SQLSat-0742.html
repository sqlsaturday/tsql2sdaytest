<h3>T-SQL advanced: Grouping and Windowing</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>This session aims to explore all the features offered by the language T-SQL for aggregating and calculating data. There's much more of the clause GROUP BY.
With grouping and ranking functions you can calculate in your query grandtotal, running totals, find islands in intervals, select the last-not-null value, etc.
Windows functions apply directly on a set of rows defined by the OVER clause ("a window"). Windows function do not perform aggregation on group level and do not hide row details.
So they allow mixing detail and total elements in the same query.
The session is mainly based on a copious array of demos, to make explicit every concept introduced taking into account the impact on performances for every solution.</p>

<h3>SSIS Custom Data Flow Components</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) include several most important components required in data acquisition, transformation, and load operations. If the problem at hand demands a solution that cannot be solved using the built-in components alone, you can resort to the freely extensible Script Component, but when the circumstances also call for a more complex, and more robust solution, that will be deployed to more than one destination server, the more appropriate alternative is to design a Custom Component.In this session you will learn how this can be achieved, what advantages it provides, and how to perform even the most complex data transformations in a standardised and reliable environment.</p>

<h3>When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we would not need any error handling, because there would be no errors. But in the real world we need to have error handling in our stored procedures. Error handling in SQL Server is a most confusing topic, because there are such great inconsistencies. But that does not mean that we as database developers can hide our head in the sand.

This presentation starts with a horror show of the many different actions SQL Server can take in case of an error. We will then learn how should deal with this - what we should do and what we should not and that with SET XACT_ABORT we get better consistency. We will learn how TRY-CATCH works in SQL Server, and we will get a recipe for how to write CATCH blocks. More generally, we will learn why it pays off to be simple-minded to survive in this maze. The session mainly looks at traditional T-SQL code, but the session ends with a quick look at natively compiled stored procedures, where everything is different.</p>

<h3>Query Folding in Power BI</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The Query Editor is possibly the most underutilised tool in Power BI Desktop. People are often more fascinated in the pretty visuals and Dashboard reporting, rather than the data transformations that take place before any of this is even possible. The Query Editor enables us to carry out a vast array of data manipulations, but often at a cost. If the transformations are not structured and ordered properly, we can find ourselves watching them complete in what feels like an eternity.

So, how can we speed up data transformations in Power BI and in turn, enhance the capabilities of the Query Editor? The answer is Query Folding. This technique takes the processing strain away from Power BI and the machine you are developing on, instead using the greater capabilities from where the data is sourced.

The 1 hour session will explain Query Folding in more detail, give examples of where/when it can be used and tips of how to get transformations to perform at their best.</p>

<h3>Database version control  deployment: model or migration scripts</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>There are fundamentally two ways to source control and deploy your databases. Either you source control the desired state/model and let software work out the upgrade scripts or you source control your upgrade scripts and run them in sequence.

Which is better? Well, that question has a tendency to divide the room.
 
I'm irritated whenever I go to a "how to do database DevOps" session and the speaker presents just one as "the right way", perhaps referring to the other as "the wrong way". Like most things, it depends.
 
I'll illustrate the limitations of each approach with a simple scenario. I'll describe which projects are better suited to a model or a migrations approach. I'll also discuss whether it's possible to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<h3>Blockchain - The data platform perspective</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Popularized by Bitcoin, now with Ethereum  Co already at least in version 2.x. 
What is technically behind the ominous blockchain, what does it have to do with databases and data warehousing? Are smart contracts only interesting for the financiers? And why should you program contracts? In the first part of this session, we deliver the background, and not just technically.

In the second part we take a closer look at the Bitcoin Blockchain as a "database". Starting point here: How anonymous really is the whole thing, when everything must be visible to everyone? After a brief introduction to its structure, we load the blockchain of bitcoin (that is, all the transactions that have been done so far) into Neo4J, a graph database and look what analyzes are possible (and why does a Graph DB work better here? And why aren’t we using the new exciting Graph stuff of SQL Server 2017???) Visualization and further analysis we do with Power BI, directly connected to Neo4j.</p>

<h3>Data Science, easy until it's not</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Data Science, it really is easier than you think. 
You’re a DBA or BI Developer?
You don’t have time to become an expert in R or Python?
You’re sick of these data science sessions that assume everyone knows statistics?
Using demo’s in SQL Server 2017 ML Services, I’ll share my experience applying Machine Learning experiments as both a DBA and BI Developer.
This way you’ll finally see how easy it can actually be to build and bring a Machine Learning experiment to production.
I’ll share good practices you should apply to make your job easier and will guide you through the end to end process using Microsoft’s Team Data Science Process.
That way you'll also have all the practical knowledge you need to do this yourself.</p>

<h3>Persistence is Futile - Implementing Delayed Durability in SQL Server</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>The concurrency model of most Relational Database Systems are defined by the ACID properties but as they aim for ever increasing transactional throughput, those rules are bent, ignored, or even broken.

In this session, we will investigate how SQL Server implements transactional durability in order to understand how Delayed Durability bends the rules to remove transactional bottlenecks and achieve improved throughput. We will take a look at how this can be used to compliment In-Memory OLTP performance, and how it might impact or compromise other things.

Attend this session and you will be assimilated!</p>

<h3>Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?</h3>
 
<p><b>Abstract</b>:</p>
<p>Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.</p>
